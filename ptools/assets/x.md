## Ultraman Zero Theme Song Music Video [English Lyrics]

The time to face your fate and duty has come
From here you shall bear light and break into darkness

For sure, someone will sound like they're waiting
The Milky Way extending into the distance
Swearing justice upon the light of your shining arms
Your name is Ultraman Zero(Zero!Zero!)

The time has come to face true kindness
If battles and hate are overcome, darkness will someday turn to light
Surely, definitely, someone is looking

Even in painful times you're not alone (someday everything will)
Swearing justice upon the light of your shining arms
Your name is Ultraman Zero(Zero!Zero!)

[To train you. To help you find your Ultra Warrior spirit. It seems the time has come. Go, Ultra Zero!]

For sure, someone will sound like they're waiting
The Milky Way extending into the distance(convey,emotions)
Swearing justice upon the light of your arms shining blue
Your name is Ultraman Zero(Zero!Zero!)


Surely, definitely, someone is looking
Even in painful times you're not alone (someday everything will)
Don't let go of that shining hand
Your name is (call out your name)
Ultraman Zero(Zero!Zero!)

[Hurry! hurry! Let's go!]
