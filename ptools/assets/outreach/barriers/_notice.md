I'm documenting my personal experiences in trying to boost 'All Lives Matter WorldWide' advocacy efforts. These records are meant to raise awareness and should not be used to blame anyone or any platform.

I go to Reddit and Facebook because people are there. These platforms are bustling with discussions on topics like war and peace, and many users express a desire for peace. I also frequent Hacker News for its technology-related content, as it's a hub for innovative minds and tech enthusiasts. I believe the DUKI system (Decentralized Universal Kindness Income) needs technology and forward-thinking individuals to become a reality, which is why I engage with these communities.

I'm unsure about the reasons behind the restrictions or account blocks I'm encountering. It might be due to my use of a VPN with a flagged IP address, or perhaps my account's reputation isn't strong enough. It's also possible that I'm not communicating my intentions clearly. Another possibility is that some moderators or influential users object to this type of advocacy, leading to increased scrutiny or limitations on my activities. The exact cause remains unclear, but these experiences highlight the challenges of promoting open dialogue on sensitive topics.


My experiences on these platforms highlight broader issues of power and information control, which are central to the "All Lives Matter Worldwide" mission. There are clear parallels between how online platforms operate and how governments manage information. Both systems filter content and restrict access, shaping the information landscape for their users or citizens. This dynamic underscores the importance of our advocacy for universal fairness and kindness.


These platforms, like governments, justify their actions as necessary to protect their communities. They have the power to decide what information is appropriate or safe, which raises important questions about transparency and the right to access diverse perspectives - questions that are at the heart of the "All Lives Matter Worldwide" initiative.

Moderation and control can prevent the spread of harmful content, but they also concentrate power over what people can see and discuss. This concentration of power is precisely what our DUKI system aims to address by promoting decentralized, fair access to resources and information.


I also want to express my thanks to the people in the community, specially "whycome" on Hacker News. I acknowledge I made a mistake with the pronunciation of DUKI. While these details may seem minor, they are important to the advocacy. DUKI is meant to sound like "duty," "kindness," and "cookie" combined - not "dookie." Oh, what a funny mistake that was! This pronunciation clarification is crucial as it aligns the acronym's sound with its positive intentions. These small yet significant details help ensure the message is communicated clearly and effectively.


If you're on these platforms and support the cause, please help share the advocacy message. I understand that not everyone may agree or may even object to this advocacy â€” that's ok, because that's part of the freedom we aim to protect: the right to say no.
