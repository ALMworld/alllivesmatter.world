I'm simply recording my personal experiences in trying to do the initial boost for the advocacy. My records here aim to raise awareness, not to blame anyone.

I'm uncertain about the exact reasons for the restrictions or account blocks I'm facing. It could be that I'm not using these social platforms correctly, or perhaps it's because I'm using a VPN with a flagged IP address. It's also possible that my account's reputation isn't sufficient.

What concerns me is that all these platforms seem to employ censorship through account blocks and restrictions. They claim it's to protect their community, but the people within the community know nothing about what they're being protected from - information they might or might not want to know. I'm unsure whether this is good or bad, as there are indeed some things people do want the system to block, like certain spam ads and so on.


Anyway, if you are on these platforms and willing to join the cause, please share the advocacy message. I understand that many people may not agree or may even object to this advocacy - that's totally okay. That is the freedom we are trying to protect: "freedom as the right to say no".

Note: The key elements of this message are listed below. You can use them or use your own words to spread the advocacy.
Www.AllLivesMatter.World is a global call for humanity and compassion, calling for peace and advocating for "Kindness First, Fairness Always, and DUKI In Action". (DUKI stands for Decentralized Universal Kindness Income.)
