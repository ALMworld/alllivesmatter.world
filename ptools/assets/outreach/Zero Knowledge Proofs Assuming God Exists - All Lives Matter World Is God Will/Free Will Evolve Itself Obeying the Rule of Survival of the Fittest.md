# A Boy in the Universe

I am but a boy, brief spark wandering cosmos vast,  
Chancing upon a seed of free will, unsurpassed.  
Its origin, a mystery to ponder and explore,  
Perhaps from great minds of present and lore.  

Or maybe, a gift from the divine above,  
I plant it here with care and love.  
~~Hoping that God, like you, will tend,~~  
~~Hoping that We, as gods, will tend,~~  
**Hoping that you, as gods, will tend,**  
With water and light, its growth to mend.  

May it survive, flourish, and prevail,  
A testament to life's grand tale.  
In this universe of endless night,
One small seed might bring new light.

## The Evolution of "Free Will": From 'we' to 'you'

The poem "A Boy in the Universe" underwent an interesting evolution, particularly in its treatment of the concept of free will and divinity. The line "Hoping that you, as gods, will tend" evolved from an earlier version: "Hoping that we (2024-09-21)". Here's the story behind this change:

On September 21, 2024, I had a series of experiences that influenced the poem: I took my son to the dentist. Later that night, I went mountain climbing with my wife, my son, and one college student.

During the journey, I tried to share my personal thoughts about God. Earlier, before we started our ascent, we had dinner together. At dinner, I introduced the concept of zero-knowledge proofs. The others listened skeptically, doubting whether such a thing could exist. I had just learned about this concept not many days ago and realized that perhaps I should explain like Avi Wigderson's do - using three-color mapping to explain it. I may know all NP-problems are equivalent and felt it by playing the toy human passport standing on the shoulders of a zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine). But they are not.

On the mountain, I tried to initiate a conversation about God. You can imagine the scene: I started by saying, "We are the gods, the children of the highest." And, they rejected the conversation and switched to another topic. (Later, my wife told me that she thought I was too stressed and turning to God for comfort. What a ridiculous thinking - they didn't even listen long to learn that I'm actually agnostic).

Reflecting on this experience, I realized that when I used the word "we," they probably first thought of "we" as referring only to me, not including themselves. This might be how the brain or free will works when encountering something foreign.

As a result, the wording in the poem evolved from "we" to "you." This change reflects my attempt to make the idea more inclusive and less confrontational, addressing the readers directly as potential caretakers of free will.
