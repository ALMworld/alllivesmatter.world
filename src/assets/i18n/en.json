It's a universal kindness-based income system funded by voluntary contributions from kind individuals and organizations worldwide. DUKI aims to empower people to gain freedom, reject evil, do good, and spread kindness. Currently, DUKI does not exist; it's merely a bold vision. This concept draws inspiration from Universal Basic Income (UBI) ideas, the wisdom of great thinkers past and present, and also the harsh realities faced by people worldwide. These realities include stories of individuals joining wars for the sole purpose of providing for their families, situations where someone's vote can be bought for just a few dollars, instances where people feel powerless against overwhelming evil, and cases where standing up for what's right leads to severe personal consequences. Life is hard, and humans are not angels. Sometimes, when given two choices, people choose the beneficial one without considering whether it's right. To be frank, I doubt if I would choose the right option if the benefits were huge and choosing otherwise incurred a big threat. I hope DUKI, if realized, raises awareness and serves as a reminder of duty and kindness among people, whether powerful or powerless. I envision it as kindness cookies that can bring hope and rejoice to all lives in the world and also help people have faith that there is kindness in humans, and there is 'God' in it. (To clarify, 'God' here is not bound to any religion. If I have to explain, I mean the Goodness of Humanity.)",

The blockchain technology that could underpin DUKI is well-suited for this kind of infrastructure, making it a viable option for implementation. Freedom is another crucial aspect of DUKI. In the blockchain world, establishing better connections often requires oracle data authorities to bridge the gap between the virtual and real worlds. The virtual world alone is insufficient, as it lacks the necessary ties to reality. There's a concern that if  authorities were to become tyrannical, they might not respond to issues or could even censor criticisms. This raises the question: can we truly trust what happens in virtual worlds under such circumstances?  DUKI system, along with any legitimate authority, empowered by  People and serving for  People, thrives on freedom. It must always respect freedom of speech. When faced with criticism, it must do whatever work is necessary to resolve mistrust, never resorting to censorship or inaction. It should also never yield to a strongman's desire for concentrated power, regardless of the stated purpose. As the timeless wisdom states: \"To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.\"",

In The Evolution of Cooperation, political scientist Robert Axelrod seeks to answer this question. In 1980, he organized the famed Computer Prisoners Dilemma Tournament, which sought to find the optimal strategy for survival in a particular game. Over and over, the simplest strategy, a cooperative program called Tit for Tat, shut out the competition. In other words, cooperation, not unfettered competition, turns out to be our best chance for survival.",

                    "Media should always wield its influence wisely. Present facts first, then offer various perspectives. Let people see the full picture and always respect their intelligence and right to form their own views. Similarly, media amplifiers should never manually manipulate news 'fitness' to favor certain powers, such as strong governments, nor should they be influenced by bribes. If anything should be favored, it should always be facts, demonstrating a commitment to the whole truth. Media amplifiers like social platforms, search engines, and other recommendation-based platforms could achieve this by prioritizing evolvable news stories rather than static ones. Evolvable news means that once published, it remains open to iterative updates and refinements. It allows for public criticism and community notes, both positive and negative. This iterative process enables people to witness the evolution of the story over time and form their own views, even when those views may challenge some authority. True authorities welcome freedom of speech. When faced with criticism, instead of resorting to censorship or inaction, they conduct further validation to prove their authenticity. With great power comes great responsibility. Media and media amplifiers should always strive to cultivate a forest of well-informed minds."

                    "DUKI (pronounced /djuːki/, reminiscent of 'duty','kindness' and 'cookie'). Think of it as 'kindness money' for everyone. It's like a global piggy bank filled by nice folks all over the world. The idea is to help people do good stuff and be kind to each other because, you know, others've already made the first move in being kind. But here's the cool part - why would people put their own money into this bank? Well, imagine this: when you chip in, you're not just giving; you're creating a world where everyone wants you to succeed even more. It's like planting seeds of goodwill everywhere. The more successful you become, the more you can contribute, and the more everyone benefits. So people aren't just hoping you do well – they're rooting for you to hit it big!",
                    "DUKIGE (pronounced /djuːki-dʒ/).  When a business or organization decides to join the kindness party by sharing some of what they've got, they transform into something pretty cool - a DUKIGE! It's like they put on a superhero cape, but instead of fighting bad guys, they're fighting... well, not-so-kindness, I guess? When a company says, 'Hey, we're gonna take a portion of our profits and spread it around to help folks,' - boom! They've just DUKIGE'd themselves! Becoming a DUKIGE can take various forms. For example, a business might commit to sharing a small part of their future success, like pledging 1% of profits once they become stable and profitable. At that point, they become a DUKIGE. It doesn't matter what size they are - whether it's a big corporation or a small mom-and-pop shop - any type of organization can become a DUKIGE in various ways. The cool thing is, once an organization becomes a DUKIGE, they're part of this global network of kindness. They're not just a business anymore - they're a business with a heart, actively contributing to make the world a bit better. Remember, it's not about how much they give. Even small contributions count. As the saying goes, \"Even a cup of cold water can make a difference.\" When a business becomes a DUKIGE, they're saying, \"We're not just here to make money - we're here to make a difference too.\" So next time you hear about a company sharing their success to help others, you can nod and say, \"Yep, they've become a DUKIGE. Cool move!\"",
                    "DUKIGER (pronounced /djuːki-dʒɚ/). Hey, Have you heard about DUKIGERs? They're pretty awesome! A DUKIGER is someone who's all about improving themselves, utilizing their potential to spread kindness, and making the world a bit better. It's like they've decided to be their own personal superhero, but instead of fighting bad guys, they're tackling the not-so-nice stuff in the world. The cool thing about DUKIGERs is that anyone can be one. You don't need superpowers or a ton of money. All you need is a big heart and the willingness to pitch in however you can. But here's the real kicker - DUKIGERs don't just stop there. They're always looking to level up their kindness game. They're all about learning new skills, cultivating their talents, and finding more ways to contribute, while nurturing their curiosity in parallel. It's like they're on a mission to gain more 'kindness superpowers' so they can make an even bigger impact. DUKIGERs are on a journey of continuous improvement, starting with themselves. They focus on personal growth, developing their skills, and becoming the best version of themselves. They know that by improving themselves, they'll be better equipped to help others. Maybe they're learning a new language to connect with more people, picking up a useful skill like first aid, or just working on being more patient and understanding. They might volunteer at a local charity, support businesses that give back, or simply be super nice to everyone they meet. Whatever it is, DUKIGERs are always looking for new ways to spread some good vibes and make their contributions even more meaningful. And here's a cool thought - maybe someday, when kids are asked, Who's the coolest person, or what's the coolest job in the world?\" they might say, \"Oh, definitely that DUKIGER named Max, or anything DUKIGER-related! How awesome would that be?",
                    "Dukiness (pronounced /ˈdjuːkiːnəs/). Alright, let's dive into Dukiness. It's a powerful idea about reshaping how we approach making the world better. At its core, Dukiness is about decentralization. We're not waiting for some president or politicians to solve everything. Sure, there are good folks in those roles, but Dukiness says it's about all of us stepping up. We're talking about supporting the just ones, building systems that truly serve people, and using tech like blockchain to keep things fair. Picture a world where power is spread out, not just concentrated at the top. When Dukiness talks about kindness, it means action. It's like that saying, \"Show me your faith without deeds, and I'll show you my faith by my deeds.\" In Dukiness, being kind means you've got a responsibility – to grow, to live up to your full potential. It's about doing the work, not just talking about it. And here's the key – Dukiness is universal. It's not limited to certain people or places. It's a global concept, a human idea, originating from the 'all lives matter worldwide'. We're talking kindness and fairness for everyone, everywhere. So, Dukiness isn't just a nice thought – it's a call to action. It's about creating a world where everyone has the power to make things better, where kindness is shown through actions, and where these principles apply to all.

However, I coined the term DUKI mainly to explicitly highlight three key aspects: decentralization, kindness, and the source of funds. While UBI could also be decentralized and kindness-based, I wanted to make these following points explicit and clear:",
                    "Decentralization: By people, for people. Power to People, it can be implemented by anyone, any organization,  anytime ,anywhere, without relying on a centralized body to create, contribute, or distribute power in the form of money. Crucially, participation must always be voluntary - no authority should ever force individuals to participate or force them out of participation. This ensures true freedom of choice, allowing people to engage or disengage based on their own will and circumstances. As Thomas Jefferson eloquently stated: 'To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.' This principle aligns perfectly with the stance on voluntary participation, emphasizing that forcing anyone to contribute to or participate in a system they disagree with is fundamentally wrong.",
                    "Reciprocity: It sparks the first flame of kindness, nurturing it into a roaring fire of compassion that spreads from one heart to another. DUKI ignites the human spirit - inspiring minds to learn, pushing boundaries in science, and fostering a relentless pursuit of knowledge and growth. It's a testament to what we can achieve when we lift each other up, creating a world where kindness begets kindness, and where our collective potential knows no bounds. By make the first kindness move and emphasizing reciprocity, DUKI aims to create a ripple effect of kindness that can transform societies from within.",
                    "NotBasicIncome: It is fundamentally determined by people's kindness and ability to offer support, with reciprocity playing a crucial role. Its amount can vary widely, providing less than basic needs, or exceeding them, depending on the social context. This flexibility allows DUKI to adapt to changing social dynamics and foster a culture of mutual support. The reciprocal nature of DUKI means that those who receive kindness are encouraged to pay it forward when they're able, creating a self-sustaining cycle of generosity. This system of give-and-take can lead to significant social improvements, as it not only addresses immediate needs but also builds stronger, more interconnected communities."

                    "Imagine this: if startups or growing companies made their first act of kindness to the world by pledging a portion of their success—say, 1-5% of their profits or more—to benefit all lives worldwide, and the world responded. If, with this blessed response and their hard work, they survived and succeeded, would this not be proof that prosperity and generosity can flourish together? This lesson extends beyond startups—any endeavor rooted in kindness and sustained by effort holds the potential for bigger, more enduring success. As the Bible reminds us, 'Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.'",
                    "Entrepreneurs, the catalysts of progress, have gifted humanity with transformative innovations—from electricity to smartphones, cryptocurrency to artificial intelligence, autonomous cars to advanced space exploration vehicles, and countless other breakthroughs. These visionaries are uniquely positioned to champion DUKI. Imagine if these innovators were to weave kindness into the very DNA of their ventures, pledging, for example, 1% of their profits to benefit all lives worldwide. Such initiatives could serve shareholders, stakeholders, and global citizens alike, harmonizing profit with societal advancement. This DUKI approach could open new frontiers of opportunity and loyalty, from Earth to the stars. By leading with generosity, entrepreneurs have the potential to ignite a cycle of inspiration and innovation, demonstrating that ethical practices and business success can be synergistic. Embodying the DUKIGE spirit, entrepreneurs could lay the groundwork for future breakthroughs, propelling humanity forward in ways we've yet to imagine."

With the help of DUKI system, some fruits of immigrants' hard work can slowly flow back to their countries of origin, spreading kindness to the lands they once called home. This approach aligns with the principles of Kindness, Fairness, and Dukiness. However, illegal immigration, especially on a massive scale, cannot be condoned.

Through DUKI, these forward-thinking governments can foster a global community where reciprocity flourishes, creating a more harmonious future. By distributing DUKI worldwide, they send a strong signal to the world that there is goodness in humanity.

Even when large companies generate millions or billions from these projects, the contributors never ask for anything in return. The world has indeed benefited greatly from their kindness and hard work!",
                    "Sometimes I wonder if they could be a bit more 'selfish' - not for themselves, but for the countless people who are less fortunate and left behind by the world. I'm thinking of those living in extreme poverty, struggling daily for basic necessities like food, clean water, and shelter. Or the millions of children lacking access to education, and the refugees displaced by conflicts and natural disasters. Additionally, there are workers displaced by technological advancements, such as taxi drivers affected by autonomous vehicles or factory workers replaced by automation. Even more concerning are those whose lives are negatively impacted by the misuse of certain technologies - invasions of privacy, and potential infringements on their civil liberties. These are people who often don't have the means to directly benefit from technological progress, let alone contribute to it.",
                    "What if new, emerging, or even legacy open-source projects released their potentially groundbreaking work with a DUKI-friendly license? This could be either a new 'DUKI[-n] License' or traditional licenses with a 'DUKI[-n] Required' clause, where 'n' represents the percentage of profit to be contributed (preferably with n between 1-5, defaulting to 1 as it's a natural starting point). Under this model, companies using DUKI-licensed projects and generating profit would be required to contribute a small percentage of their earnings towards fostering universal kindness. If they haven't made a profit, everything would remain the same as with current licenses. It's worth noting that the companies behind the creators and main maintainers of these open-source projects would be exempt from this requirement, though they could always choose to contribute voluntarily. Their act of releasing and maintaining the project as open-source is already a significant contribution, often involving substantial effort and resources. And we should reward kindness with kindness, making these companies more competitive for engaging in such generous acts. As the saying goes again, 'Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.'",

Can we harness the power inherent in cryptography to somehow alleviate the tremendous level of mistrust?' I sincerely believe that the answer is yes. Through decentralization, blockchain can distribute power to everyone, ensuring that all participants act with kindness and fairness, ultimately benefiting all. I firmly believe that innovations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, WorldID, ZK-STARKs, zkVM, and numerous others, contributed by talented and brilliant individuals, will have valuable applications in human society in the years to come. They will benefit humanity in ways we have yet to imagine. In this context, I believe the DUKI system, kindness by all and promoting kindness for all, will be one of the first significant applications to emerge.",

As for DUKI contributions, I believe they can largely be solved by existing blockchain technology. Each DUKIGE could have a smart contract operating on the blockchain. These contracts would store and automatically transfer funds to distribution shard contracts to facilitate fair distribution. The total amount could be divided among 1 thousand people, then 1 million, and finally enough for all humans worldwide who are chain, allowing each to claim their DUKI when they prove their uniqueness.",

After recently watching a <a class='inline_ref' target='new' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu_j5_tains\"> 12-year-old video</a> named 'Professor Avi Wigderson on cryptography', a statement struck me: 'Everything that can be proven at all can be proven in zero knowledge - not just some things, not nothing, everything that can be proven can be proven in zero knowledge.' Does this include proving \"everyone's unique existence in the world using their private unique and untakeable traits\"? If true, this could truly form the foundation of the DUKI infrastructure.",
                    "Later, I realized that technology like WorldID has already demonstrated this concept, although there are concerns. The centralized storage of human iris codes could lead to potential blockage by unfriendly countries, and there are also other concerns, potentially slowing down its mass adoption. Despite these challenges, this innovative approach that gives each human a unique world ID is definitely the way to go. By incorporating more strength and decentralization, we could accelerate adoption and empower all humans in our increasingly digital world.",
                    "Is it technically possible to achieve proof of unique human existence using zero-knowledge proofs without collecting centralized iris code data? Could this be accomplished by using zero-knowledge proofs of iris data stored on local devices, similar to Apple's Optic ID 1-to-few matching approach, but dramatically scaling it up to a universal 1-to-n system<a class='inline_ref' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_rkxyw_U84&t=1535s' target='new'>&nbsp;»</a>? Could we create a unique identifier on a public blockchain without leaking any of the user's private data, so that everyone could utilize it without applying for it first, making it more widely decentralized? Furthermore, is it possible to standardize a zero-knowledge proof of user uniqueness and create a Humanity Proof RFC (Request for Comments) to make it standard, so that all manufacturers could implement it in smartphones, VR headsets, and other devices, thus truly enabling DUKI? I feel this approach, if possible, might be the fastest way to fully champion DUKI.",
                    "As someone with no practical blockchain job experience, I've imagined how a DUKI system might distribute funds using Human Passports—where each unique human gets one and only one zkp-backed privacy passport. To help think through this scenario, I created a toy  <a class='inline_ref' target='new' href=\"https://github.com/KindKang/alllivesmatter.world/tree/main/ptools/human_passport\">program</a> using zkVM, with the code stored in the same repository as the advocacy materials. While I don't want to focus on the details here,  I want to emphasize a crucial point I realized from this exercise in the context of DUKI distribution: Blockchain technology, initially conceived to bring decentralization, foster freedom, and resolve issues of distrust, paradoxically needs both \"true authorities\" and freedom in reality to reach its full potential. These true authorities, empowered by people and serving for people, are essential. They must always respect freedom of speech. And when faced with criticism, they must do whatever work is necessary to resolve mistrust, never resorting to censorship or inaction. To truly bring the sunshine of blockchain technology into the real world, we must look beyond technology alone. I sincerely hope that all kinds of technologists - from enthusiasts to skeptics - could put more efforts into this and also help build the DUKI system."

While it's impossible to name everyone and everything, I'd like to acknowledge some key influences: Donald Trump's call for \"I want everyone to stop dying,\" Tommee Profitt's rendition of \"O come, O come, Omeemsu,\" and the BLM movement's slogan \"Black Lives Matter\" (too) have been key inspirations. The evolutionary discoveries by Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins, and Robert Axelrod laid the groundwork underpinning this advocacy. \"Freedom as the right to say no\" and \"Freedom as the power to say no\" inspired 'DUKI In Action'. These freedom concepts have roots in both historical minds like George Orwell and contemporary thinkers, such as Karl Widerquist. While the former is a truth to uphold, the latter addresses a practical challenge: what if exercising this right becomes unaffordable under unjust rule? As the saying goes, 'When the wicked rule, the people groan.' Thus, DUKI helps to empower all lives to say no to the unrighteous. Avi Wigderson's \"Everything that can be proven at all can be proven in zero knowledge\" highlights the DUKI system's technological plausibility, with blockchain innovations like zkVM and Worldcoin's WorldID further backing it up. I sincerely hope all these blockchain-related innovations will be used or evolved to make the DUKI system a reality, leaving countries that serve the people no excuse to refuse it. Tools from Facebook's ReactJS, and affordable services from Cloudflare and Zoho have been crucial, and insights from the X platform have reinforced my sense of duty. AI pioneers have expanded possibilities beyond imagination, letting me engage with great minds like Lord Acton's thoughts on power and liberty and various profound ideas from the Bible, and also assisting in refining my words. Without all of this, an ordinary person like me would never have been able to initiate this advocacy. I credit all these efforts, along with mine, to the goodness of humanity.

I want to be clear that I never used these tools for harmful purposes. My intention was solely to expand my understanding and contribute to the task at hand. I'm not trying to make excuses or blame anyone for defining these actions as 'illegal,' given the complex and harsh realities the world faces now. My hope is that when fighting against evil, we always fight with humanity and compassion, ensuring we don't become the very thing we're opposing.",

Even though these companies excel at their services and have shown initial kindness through their free tiers, I still won't upgrade to premium unless I see the need to, given the limited resources of an ordinary person. While kindness doesn't always guarantee reciprocation, and too many individuals taking advantage could potentially corrupt such generosity, violating the principle that 'kindness begets kindness', I sincerely hope those with means and a concern for freedom will prefer these generous companies when choosing between comparable options. If they meet both needs and budget, why not support them? They may primarily focus on marketing, but they actually support freedom in practice. Looking ahead, I sincerely hope the DUKI system becomes a reality, empowering everyone to support companies that excel at their offerings and also spread kindness, without the hesitation and second thoughts I've experienced."

I'm KindKang, a person with a <a class='inline_ref' target='new' href='https://github.com/KindKang/alllivesmatter.world/tree/main/ptools/human_passport'>Human Passport</a> generated using zero-knowledge proofs - a fascinating technique that ensures trustworthiness while protecting privacy. Is all the information on the passport trustworthy now? Well, some is believable now, while some requires more work to make it trustworthy. For the trustworthy parts: my contact email is true, and the following claim is true - the secret I used (which I won't disclose, of course) contains my nickname, and before it, there's 'ordinary'. Regarding the 'ordinary' part, even without official authority, you can judge from my HireMeAsAmbassador ad below, but remember, even if I am ordinary, my words and actions still matter; all lives matter, don't they?. The other parts of info in my passport, such as whether I used my real name and real iris data, aren't fully trustworthy without authorities to back them up. However, I believe that through advocacy, hard work, and drawing more attention to legitimate authorities and developing more reliable ones, we can make it fully trustworthy. By 'authority' I mean entities that respond to criticism with transparency and additional proof, rather than censorship or inaction. Combining trustworthy authorities with currently available or emerging technologies, I believe we can establish a solid Web3 foundation for humanity in the coming years. In that world, All lives will have equal opportunities to grow towards their own unique potential, flourishing in all their diversity, and enabling all to achieve their own unique excellence.",
                    "Shameless HireMeAsAnAmbassador Ad:I'm seeking companies that value the 'AllLivesMatter.World' advocacy - even better if you're willing to make it a reality by becoming a DUKIGE (I'm thinking great companies like ...) or developing technology (I'm thinking ...) to power it. I invite you to consider me as a remote, independent ambassador. I ask you to evaluate me solely on my merits and potential contributions, regardless of nationality, color, background, beliefs, or any other factors. I'm committed to promoting your hard work and kindness to the world. Note: By 'independent,' I mean I maintain the freedom to occasionally promote other DUKI-friendly companies if more appear, but I wouldn't promote your direct competitors unless I quit. Here are a few ordinary facts about me: My primary work experience is Java-based and business-oriented, and I have no work experience in blockchain technology as yet. I learn most things driven by curiosity. While English isn't my first language, and I hardly speak it in daily life, I can understand it quite well and often catch myself thinking in English. I believe language won't be a barrier to effective communication.",
                    "I don't know what the future holds for this advocacy. I sensed my dukiness and initiated it, and I will give it an initial boost and keep advocating for it until the end of my life or until I'm forcibly stopped by circumstances beyond my control. As I believe, 'All Lives Matter World' is unstoppable. The source code is released under 'DUKI LICENSE', which is essentially the same as the MIT license with an additional condition: if you're using the code as a profit-making entity and your entity turns a profit, you should donate 1% to DUKI. Currently, there's no DUKI system in place for donations or to verify this behavior, but you can still fulfill this spirit by showing kindness to those who need help. In the future, if possible, I'll try to bootstrap one or more tiny DUKIGEs, though currently I have no idea what they would be like. I won't accept donations or intend to commercialize this advocacy for personal gain, now or in the future. Moreover, please don't expect too much from me – I'm just an ordinary person with a challenging life to maintain. I can only pursue this advocacy in my spare time or, better yet, through a job that enables me to continue this work while simultaneously earning a living."

                    "After the poem written jointly by me, the LLM, and perhaps God, I decided to share my personal story about why I initiated the \"All Lives Matter World\" advocacy.",
                    "I consider myself agnostic, recognizing the limitations of my understanding, and standing fully aware and in awe of the Unknown. As an ordinary person, I believe that the 'All Lives Matter World' is a good free will. Assuming God exists, I believe that is God's will also. GOOD FREE WILL LIVES FOREVER and GOD WILL LIVES FOREVER.",
                    "I will not argue whether God exists or not, but I have a strong belief that if God does exist, then 'all lives matter world' is His Will, and He will be angry if His Will is abandoned like shit.",
                    "The intriguing coincidences I've experienced may suggest something greater, hinting at intelligent design. Like a zero-knowledge proof, they demonstrate possibilities without revealing the underlying truth.",
                    "After the poem was jointly written by me, an LLM, and maybe God, I decided to share my personal story initiating the advocacy. Let me share some coincidences that led me to initiate the advocacy. Are they pure coincidences, or are they a form of zero-knowledge proof that God is trying to demonstrate His existence without revealing it to me? I do not know. But if God does exist and loves using zero-knowledge to prove His existence, He will forgive me for being agnostic and will praise me for having awe for the Unknown.",
                    "I was born a bit of a science enthusiast, especially when it comes to physics and math. I did receive some inspiration from a few great minds in high school, particularly from my physics teacher. I’m sorry to say that I haven’t been in touch with him since graduation, and I’ve never let him know how much I appreciate his guidance and inspiration. I believe that computer science could have been a good fit for me in college, but I never had the opportunity to major in it. By the time I understood my options, my decisions had already been made, making it difficult to change course.",
                    "I majored in ecology. I was not that interested in many of the content and in how it was taught in college most of the time, but the concepts of ecological and evolutionary process and modern biology knowledge indeed captured my interest. I also learned the concepts of swarms, whose global intelligence emerged by simple units following simple rules like the evolutionary principle of survival of the fittest. I even have my web name taking inspiration from that. Anyway, these kind of knowledge and inherent curiosity prepared my mind for evolutionary thinking.",
                    "However, my college experience wasn’t solely defined by my major. There were other experiences that helped shape my personality and intellectual growth.",
                    "In my first year of college, I discovered a fascination with philosophy. Though I didn’t know much about it, I borrowed a book from the library written by Arthur Schopenhauer, \"Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung\" (in English, \"The World as Will and Representation\"). I was captivated and tried to think as the author did. I remember discussing the concept of Will-thing with my maybe ex-girlfriend, sitting by a warm fireplace on a snowy night. What a wonderful experience, though maybe I never kissed her, and now we are both fathers and mothers and have never contacted once.",
                    "Also, I got my first computer as a gift for college entry. Yes, that was a wonderful thing for me, a person who, until then, rarely watched TV because my family never got one, just like many others I knew. It was a fascinating thing, but sadly I never used it to learn something interesting systematically, mainly for gaming and surfing the news. I was often saddened by news headlines about coal miner accidents where many people died.",
                    "I was far away from home, and my father was an ordinary miner worker. He worked as a coal miner. Before I went to college, I went with him to the deep, dark underground and worked along with him once. It was not a modern workspace like we saw on television; it was quite raw. There were many tunnels that were dug by hand with simple tools, tunnels that barely allowed one person to crawl in. The miners would crawl into these narrow passages with their tools, dig coal, and then drag it out to reach the railway. There was no light, only a tiny lamp on their heads. All you could see was darkness, and all you could touch was coal. Under these conditions, accidents that caused deaths sometimes occurred.",
                    "I was worried about my father whenever I saw this kind of news, but luckily, though some accidents happened, my father was okay and got retired. Thank God. At that time, whenever I saw this kind of news, I hoped the world would do something to care for the miners’ safety. I emotionally commented on the news to urge people to take action, and after many tries, I realized that free will seemed powerless, the world moved as usual, and these tragedies still happened quite often nowdays. I was an angry youth, furious at everyone’s indifference.",
                    "But during my third year, I took a literature elective course and became fascinated by a regionalist writer. The author just described people as they were, with humanity and understanding. Maybe affected by this free will, and after some reflection, I realized that my mother and father were just like the indifferent people I was angry at. They didn’t care about these complex issues; sometimes they enjoyed hatred war movies, gaining a sense of pride when our nation won in the movies. They didn’t care about politics that much, and maybe deep in their minds and experiences they believed not all lives matter that much, and they saw themselves among those who didn’t matter. They just wanted to live their lives and take care of their children, hoping that their children would get a proper education and live a not-that-hard life, and that’s it. They had kind hearts and were good to their neighbors, unless some realistic conflicts arose, just like the neighbors did. Many times they cared about partiality over totality, maybe because they didn’t have the wisdom to discern right from wrong, or maybe that’s the nature of free will, always wanting to join together with the free will of similar people, I think it maybe that could be explained better by the selfish gene theory.",
                    "After this realization, I was no longer that angry anymore. I understood there was always a reason behind the tragic events that happened, perhaps viewing them as conflicts of free will using Arthur Schopenhauer’s thinking. Maybe some of those people never had proper education, or they may never have felt much kindness from the world except from a few family members; some didn’t even get love from their family and most probably, they might have experienced significant hostility and hardship from the world. They could have great talents, potential, and acquired wisdom, but unfortunately, the world rarely gave them the opportunity to cultivate these. They just needed to blindly do anything that could ensure their survival. There was always a reason. It is not purely their fault to blame; the constant struggle against hostility and adversity could have shaped their perspectives and actions. And probably, I wouldn’t do better than them if I had lived the lives they lived, facing the hostilities they faced. The free will of goodness may never get the freedom to fully grow.",
                    "Anyway, I just felt a hint of the world’s coldness, but I still did not fully experience the merciless reality out there. My parents shielded me from much of it, and I remained a relatively carefree youth. I lived happily for four years with my roommates, building deep friendships. That was really one of the happiest moments in my life.",
                    "Time to graduate, I still did not know what to do. I didn’t have enough knowledge to decide. I was curious about how the mind works. Deep in the night, some words emerged from my mind, one word after another. (Yes, before that time, LLM was not a thing like it is currently now) I wondered if human minds are determined or not. Is there a probability that, given certain circumstances including previous situations of mind and body, we can predict what our next word and deed will be? As an afterthought, this kind of thinking is similar to how LLMs work, as I currently learned. It also relates to my mother’s epilepsy. I wondered, a few times, why she goes into a near-unconscious state, moving instinctively and saying caring and loving words to her boy. (Sorry, Mom; your love for me is so selfless and God-like. You are truly one of the people I cherish most, and maybe your love is the real reason I want the world to be kinder and nicer to people like you.) Only later did I find out that this behavior is triggered by electrotherapy, which is unsuitable for people with epilepsy, yet was recommended without conscience by profit-driven salesmen who hinted it was beneficial for everyone in any situation.",
                    "Anyway, driven by curiosity about how the brain works, I tried to choose a graduate advisor who studied neuroscience. However, after spending some time learning and working with a doctor in the same lab, I found that their research was too simple to satisfy my inquisitive mind. Additionally, a senior doctoral colleague, who was planning to leave the research field to become a medical doctor, advised me to think seriously about my career path. Ultimately, I decided not to pursue that route. Instead, I chose an easier path and continued my studies in ecology but quit after about a year to work outside academia",
                    "Although I didn’t continue my studies in ecology, the knowledge I gained made me accustomed to thinking in ecological and evolutionary way. Darwin’s concept of survival of the fittest revealed hard truths about the universe. The idea of the selfish gene illuminated the reality that we should never assume others are angels and explained how selfish love and hate can make sense. It also showed why we should strive for peace, as destroying each other would be counterproductive causing all genes to be lost. The evolution of cooperation and the conflicts arising from selfishness, such as those in sexual selection, could actually give rise to angelic behavior in humans — those who prioritize kindness and always strive for fairness.",
                    "Anyway, after quitting, I struggled to find a junior job in the tech sector. I learned the Spring framework and about transactions that are atomic — once done, they never roll back, so we must be careful and ensure all necessary effects are in place for the commit. I worked hard from early 9 to late 9 and sometimes six days a week just to support my family and maintain my independence. I felt the reality of the world that was always there; it was a tough and inspiring experience. Life is not easy, especially for ordinary people. The world outside their family and friends does not offer much kindness to most. The world cares more about competition and profit; some compete for excellence, but most do so just for survival and profit. Companies and bosses are also subject to the harsh, objective rules of survival of the fittest. Those that don’t rely on government relationships must maintain high efficiency to maximize their chances of survival in the merciless Darwinian business world. They need to make profits to survive, which can lead them to push harder on ordinary employees to achieve this.",
                    "Almost everyone and every organization competes to be the fittest. It’s quite an eye-opening experience. All entities face challenges; they each have different battles to confront, whether you’re an ordinary worker, a company, or a millionaire looking to multiply your profits. They all adhere to the rule of survival of the fittest. This kind of competitiveness can sometimes make us forget what we’re truly competing for, leading to a lack of kindness and even to evil behavior. My mother worked day and night during her younger days; she has grown old but is not entitled to a pension that she should get to support her survival. Universal kindness is not that common in our modern society.",
                    "For me, the situation was better than in her days, although I was occupied with work, I still had some spare time. I sometimes wished I could find more meaning in it instead of just making money and competing for survival. During my spare time, I maintained the habit of absorbing wisdom from MOOCs and MOOC-like resources. I treated it as an opportunity for free will exploration; some resources had practical utility, while others were simply for curiosity.",
                    "During my exploration, I learned about bitcoins and bought some at a very early stage. However, I missed out on a significant fortune because I sold before it skyrocketed. I’m excited about WorldID and Worldcoin, even though I lost some money when Worldcoin dropped from 5 to 1 and my account got banned by their official team on X due to my advocacy for \"all lives matter world\". I took a few MOOCs and watched some videos to try to understand how the magic works. Through this experience, I learned about what decentralization is and how it is unstoppable — though I don’t know much about the technical details yet. I sensed that it could be a way for the world where all lives truly matter, even for those in the shadows like me. Yes, 'all lives matter worldwide' is the truth the world should uphold. It is not just duty, kindness, and care for all lives worldwide; it’s also a superpower for everyone. Holding it, everyone has the power to demand that they be treated with fairness.",
                    "About a year ago, in 2023, the company decided to cut jobs, and I was one of them. I received a pension and took a break. I thought to myself, should I continue without a break, or maybe take some time off (how about one gap year) to do something that satisfies my free will? Better yet, could I find a way to do both — satisfy my free will and make a living at the same time? So, I went on tour, did some other things, and built an English learning app. I finished it and published it, but at the time of writing, I’m pretty sure no more than 100 people have downloaded my app. I knew nothing about marketing and was really bad at it.",
                    "During that marketing time, I came across Trump’s interview where he said, \"I want everyone to stop dying; they are dying.\" This call resonated deeply with me. I remembered the worry I felt about my father and the despair I experienced during my college years when I saw news about miners dying. I witnessed this brave and compassionate heart being attacked and humiliated, labeled as a coward and puppet by those with evil intentions or indifference. Rather than stand by uselessly, I decided to take action as an ordinary human who believes that all lives should matter and also that all lives do matter. I wanted to join the fight; I wanted to fight with humanity and fight for peace. That’s how this advocacy was born. I just wish for peace for everyone.",
                    "During the advocacy’s initial phase, I composed the 9 letters except the one for God. Last night, my X account was blocked. I can’t log in and was locked out. I’m reading about it on reddit; it says 24 hours and some say 3 days. I wish it will be okay. I can feel Elon Musk's free will and his respect for others’ free will, but he doesn’t have the power or right to make everyone obey his will.",
                    "During that sleepless night, the poem about free will came to my mind, and I prompted it and it was born. Really, I truly enjoy it, a zero-proof that God may prove its existence to me. I am worried more about the free will seed getting killed. The worries extend to Cloudflare too. What if the company decides to take it down? I suddenly thought of the Web3 domain name. It’s better to put it on blockchain and make it more censorship-resistant, so I bought alllivesmatterworld.eth (the alllivesmatter.eth was already taken) and kindkang.eth, also alllivematterworld.unstoppable and a other domains.",
                    "I will finish the letters to God as soon as possible and try to put the website on alllivesmatterworld.unstoppable, and then actively seek a Web3 job, hoping to get hired by a great company to make a living. My wife sometimes pretends to be angry at my apparent unwillingness to actively seek jobs due to my focus on the advocacy. Initially, I argued, \"How could you not respect this good free will? Look at what I’m doing.\" Later, I found it amusing. What does \"fairness always\" really mean? Certainly, she has a right to demand fairness and be angry — after all, don’t all lives matter? She has already shown me so much kindness and love. I should respond to her kindness with kindness, not exploit or take advantage of it. I must fulfill my duties as a husband. (please don’t misunderstand, my family is not poor, just financially ordinary). Also, the promise of a one-year gap for my free will satisfaction is almost complete. \"Fairness Always\" — I’ve found real peace in this realization, and I hope I always remember it.",
                    "After this realization and the emergence of NFT ideas during the Web3 domain registration process, I've decided to modify some of the promises I made in the advocacy repository. Originally, I promised that I wouldn’t accept donations or attempt to commercialize this advocacy for personal gain, now or in the future. However, considering that all lives matter and all lives must follow the harsh rule of survival of the fittest, which may have been established by God, pretending to be a selfless angel and expecting others to do the same is both immoral and sinful. That’s not the right path. This promise is too restrictive and doesn’t recognize the value of entrepreneurship or encourage innovation.",
                    "I’ve decided to shift to a DUKI-95 model, where 95% of the profits will be distributed to all humans. While respecting the DUKI license, core contributors and the initial team will be exempt from this rule, allowing them to retain 100% of their profits. However, considering the bold and naïve promise I made earlier, I seek forgiveness from God for breaking it. To atone for my mistake, I will only take 1% of the profits, while 99% will go towards DUKI, in the hope that this will further support the advocacy. This 1% for DUKI could also be the default starting point for any serious business venture out there. After all, everything starts with 1 — the first number after 0, much like in 'O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.'  I hope someday it could stand and survive in the Darwinian world while also spreading kindness.",
                    "As this journey of reflection comes to a close, I am compelled to acknowledge and express my gratitude. I want to say to the people who have shown kindness to me, whether I've met  or not—be it family, inspiring teachers, friends, or just inspiring minds and MOOC educators—thank you. Your words, deeds, and kindness really matter to me. And to all other people out there: your lives truly matter and are especially invaluable to those you've shown your kindness and love.",
                    "To all lives in the world: Just by exercising your duty with a loving heart, you are being divine to the world, whether you are ordinary or extraordinary.",
                    "And if there is a God, all lives are gods; all lives are children of the Most High. All lives have the power and duty of God.",
                    "Whether you believe in God or not, let us use this power and exercise this duty, and fight together for a world where all lives truly matter—this is His will and our free will's destiny."
