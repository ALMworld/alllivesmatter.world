It's a universal kindness-based income system funded by voluntary contributions from kind individuals and organizations worldwide. DUKI aims to empower people to gain freedom, reject evil, do good, and spread kindness. Currently, DUKI does not exist; it's merely a bold vision. This concept draws inspiration from Universal Basic Income (UBI) ideas, the wisdom of great thinkers past and present, and also the harsh realities faced by people worldwide. These realities include stories of individuals joining wars for the sole purpose of providing for their families, situations where someone's vote can be bought for just a few dollars, instances where people feel powerless against overwhelming evil, and cases where standing up for what's right leads to severe personal consequences. Life is hard, and humans are not angels. Sometimes, when given two choices, people choose the beneficial one without considering whether it's right. To be frank, I doubt if I would choose the right option if the benefits were huge and choosing otherwise incurred a big threat. I hope DUKI, if realized, raises awareness and serves as a reminder of duty and kindness among people, whether powerful or powerless. I envision it as kindness cookies that can bring hope and rejoice to all lives in the world and also help people have faith that there is kindness in humans, and there is 'God' in it. (To clarify, 'God' here is not bound to any religion. If I have to explain, I mean the Goodness of Humanity.)",

The blockchain technology that could underpin DUKI is well-suited for this kind of infrastructure, making it a viable option for implementation. Freedom is another crucial aspect of DUKI. In the blockchain world, establishing better connections often requires oracle data authorities to bridge the gap between the virtual and real worlds. The virtual world alone is insufficient, as it lacks the necessary ties to reality. There's a concern that if  authorities were to become tyrannical, they might not respond to issues or could even censor criticisms. This raises the question: can we truly trust what happens in virtual worlds under such circumstances?  DUKI system, along with any legitimate authority, empowered by  People and serving for  People, thrives on freedom. It must always respect freedom of speech. When faced with criticism, it must do whatever work is necessary to resolve mistrust, never resorting to censorship or inaction. It should also never yield to a strongman's desire for concentrated power, regardless of the stated purpose. As the timeless wisdom states: \"To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.\"",

In The Evolution of Cooperation, political scientist Robert Axelrod seeks to answer this question. In 1980, he organized the famed Computer Prisoners Dilemma Tournament, which sought to find the optimal strategy for survival in a particular game. Over and over, the simplest strategy, a cooperative program called Tit for Tat, shut out the competition. In other words, cooperation, not unfettered competition, turns out to be our best chance for survival.",

Similarly, media amplifiers should never manually manipulate news 'fitness' to favor certain powers, such as strong governments, nor should they be influenced by bribes. If anything should be favored, it should always be facts, demonstrating a commitment to the whole truth. Media amplifiers like social platforms, search engines, and other recommendation-based platforms could achieve this by prioritizing evolvable news stories rather than static ones. Evolvable news means that once published, it remains open to iterative updates and refinements. It allows for public criticism and community notes, both positive and negative. This iterative process enables people to witness the evolution of the story over time and form their own views, even when those views may challenge some authority. True authorities welcome freedom of speech. When faced with criticism, instead of resorting to censorship or inaction, they conduct further validation to prove their authenticity. With great power comes great responsibility. Media and media amplifiers should always strive to cultivate a forest of well-informed minds."

                    "DUKI (pronounced /djuːki/, reminiscent of 'duty','kindness' and 'cookie'). Think of it as 'kindness money' for everyone. It's like a global piggy bank filled by nice folks all over the world. The idea is to help people do good stuff and be kind to each other because, you know, others've already made the first move in being kind. But here's the cool part - why would people put their own money into this bank? Well, imagine this: when you chip in, you're not just giving; you're creating a world where everyone wants you to succeed even more. It's like planting seeds of goodwill everywhere. The more successful you become, the more you can contribute, and the more everyone benefits. So people aren't just hoping you do well – they're rooting for you to hit it big!",
                    "DUKIGE (pronounced /djuːki-dʒ/).  When a business or organization decides to join the kindness party by sharing some of what they've got, they transform into something pretty cool - a DUKIGE! It's like they put on a superhero cape, but instead of fighting bad guys, they're fighting... well, not-so-kindness, I guess? When a company says, 'Hey, we're gonna take a portion of our profits and spread it around to help folks,' - boom! They've just DUKIGE'd themselves! Becoming a DUKIGE can take various forms. For example, a business might commit to sharing a small part of their future success, like pledging 1% of profits once they become stable and profitable. At that point, they become a DUKIGE. It doesn't matter what size they are - whether it's a big corporation or a small mom-and-pop shop - any type of organization can become a DUKIGE in various ways. The cool thing is, once an organization becomes a DUKIGE, they're part of this global network of kindness. They're not just a business anymore - they're a business with a heart, actively contributing to make the world a bit better. Remember, it's not about how much they give. Even small contributions count. As the saying goes, \"Even a cup of cold water can make a difference.\" When a business becomes a DUKIGE, they're saying, \"We're not just here to make money - we're here to make a difference too.\" So next time you hear about a company sharing their success to help others, you can nod and say, \"Yep, they've become a DUKIGE. Cool move!\"",

A DUKIGER is someone who's all about improving themselves, utilizing their potential to spread kindness, and making the world a bit better. It's like they've decided to be their own personal superhero, but instead of fighting bad guys, they're tackling the not-so-nice stuff in the world. The cool thing about DUKIGERs is that anyone can be one. You don't need superpowers or a ton of money. All you need is a big heart and the willingness to pitch in however you can. But here's the real kicker - DUKIGERs don't just stop there. They're always looking to level up their kindness game. They're all about learning new skills, cultivating their talents, and finding more ways to contribute, while nurturing their curiosity in parallel. It's like they're on a mission to gain more 'kindness superpowers' so they can make an even bigger impact. DUKIGERs are on a journey of continuous improvement, starting with themselves. They focus on personal growth, developing their skills, and becoming the best version of themselves. They know that by improving themselves, they'll be better equipped to help others. Maybe they're learning a new language to connect with more people, picking up a useful skill like first aid, or just working on being more patient and understanding. They might volunteer at a local charity, support businesses that give back, or simply be super nice to everyone they meet. Whatever it is, DUKIGERs are always looking for new ways to spread some good vibes and make their contributions even more meaningful. And here's a cool thought - maybe someday, when kids are asked, Who's the coolest person, or what's the coolest job in the world?\" they might say, \"Oh, definitely that DUKIGER named Max, or anything DUKIGER-related! How awesome would that be?",
                    "Dukiness (pronounced /ˈdjuːkiːnəs/). Alright, let's dive into Dukiness. It's a powerful idea about reshaping how we approach making the world better. At its core, Dukiness is about decentralization. We're not waiting for some president or politicians to solve everything. Sure, there are good folks in those roles, but Dukiness says it's about all of us stepping up. We're talking about supporting the just ones, building systems that truly serve people, and using tech like blockchain to keep things fair. Picture a world where power is spread out, not just concentrated at the top. When Dukiness talks about kindness, it means action. It's like that saying, \"Show me your faith without deeds, and I'll show you my faith by my deeds.\" In Dukiness, being kind means you've got a responsibility – to grow, to live up to your full potential. It's about doing the work, not just talking about it. And here's the key – Dukiness is universal. It's not limited to certain people or places. It's a global concept, a human idea, originating from the 'all lives matter worldwide'. We're talking kindness and fairness for everyone, everywhere. So, Dukiness isn't just a nice thought – it's a call to action. It's about creating a world where everyone has the power to make things better, where kindness is shown through actions, and where these principles apply to all.

However, I coined the term DUKI mainly to explicitly highlight three key aspects: decentralization, kindness, and the source of funds. While UBI could also be decentralized and kindness-based, I wanted to make these following points explicit and clear:",
                    "Decentralization: By people, for people. Power to People, it can be implemented by anyone, any organization,  anytime ,anywhere, without relying on a centralized body to create, contribute, or distribute power in the form of money. Crucially, participation must always be voluntary - no authority should ever force individuals to participate or force them out of participation. This ensures true freedom of choice, allowing people to engage or disengage based on their own will and circumstances. As Thomas Jefferson eloquently stated: 'To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.' This principle aligns perfectly with the stance on voluntary participation, emphasizing that forcing anyone to contribute to or participate in a system they disagree with is fundamentally wrong.",

DUKI ignites the human spirit - inspiring minds to learn, pushing boundaries in science, and fostering a relentless pursuit of knowledge and growth. It's a testament to what we can achieve when we lift each other up, creating a world where kindness begets kindness, and where our collective potential knows no bounds. By make the first kindness move and emphasizing reciprocity, DUKI aims to create a ripple effect of kindness that can transform societies from within.",
                    "NotBasicIncome: It is fundamentally determined by people's kindness and ability to offer support, with reciprocity playing a crucial role. Its amount can vary widely, providing less than basic needs, or exceeding them, depending on the social context. This flexibility allows DUKI to adapt to changing social dynamics and foster a culture of mutual support. The reciprocal nature of DUKI means that those who receive kindness are encouraged to pay it forward when they're able, creating a self-sustaining cycle of generosity. This system of give-and-take can lead to significant social improvements, as it not only addresses immediate needs but also builds stronger, more interconnected communities."

                    "Imagine this: if startups or growing companies made their first act of kindness to the world by pledging a portion of their success—say, 1-5% of their profits or more—to benefit all lives worldwide, and the world responded. If, with this blessed response and their hard work, they survived and succeeded, would this not be proof that prosperity and generosity can flourish together? This lesson extends beyond startups—any endeavor rooted in kindness and sustained by effort holds the potential for bigger, more enduring success. As the Bible reminds us, 'Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.'",

These visionaries are uniquely positioned to champion DUKI. Imagine if these innovators were to weave kindness into the very DNA of their ventures, pledging, for example, 1% of their profits to benefit all lives worldwide. Such initiatives could serve shareholders, stakeholders, and global citizens alike, harmonizing profit with societal advancement. This DUKI approach could open new frontiers of opportunity and loyalty, from Earth to the stars. By leading with generosity, entrepreneurs have the potential to ignite a cycle of inspiration and innovation, demonstrating that ethical practices and business success can be synergistic. Embodying the DUKIGE spirit, entrepreneurs could lay the groundwork for future breakthroughs, propelling humanity forward in ways we've yet to imagine."

Additionally, there are workers displaced by technological advancements, such as taxi drivers affected by autonomous vehicles or factory workers replaced by automation.

Under this model, companies using DUKI-licensed projects and generating profit would be required to contribute a small percentage of their earnings towards fostering universal kindness. If they haven't made a profit, everything would remain the same as with current licenses. It's worth noting that the companies behind the creators and main maintainers of these open-source projects would be exempt from this requirement, though they could always choose to contribute voluntarily. Their act of releasing and maintaining the project as open-source is already a significant contribution, often involving substantial effort and resources. And we should reward kindness with kindness, making these companies more competitive for engaging in such generous acts. As the saying goes again, 'Give, and it will be given to you.

Can we harness the power inherent in cryptography to somehow alleviate the tremendous level of mistrust?' I sincerely believe that the answer is yes. Through decentralization, blockchain can distribute power to everyone, ensuring that all participants act with kindness and fairness, ultimately benefiting all. I firmly believe that innovations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, WorldID, ZK-STARKs, zkVM, and numerous others, contributed by talented and brilliant individuals, will have valuable applications in human society in the years to come.

As for DUKI contributions, I believe they can largely be solved by existing blockchain technology. Each DUKIGE could have a smart contract operating on the blockchain. These contracts would store and automatically transfer funds to distribution shard contracts to facilitate fair distribution.

Could we create a unique identifier on a public blockchain without leaking any of the user's private data, so that everyone could utilize it without applying for it first, making it more widely decentralized? Furthermore, is it possible to standardize a zero-knowledge proof of user uniqueness and create a Humanity Proof RFC (Request for Comments) to make it standard, so that all manufacturers could implement it in smartphones, VR headsets, and other devices, thus truly enabling DUKI? I feel this approach, if possible, might be the fastest way to fully champion DUKI.",

To help think through this scenario, I created a toy  <a class='inline_ref' target='new' href=\"https://github.com/KindKang/alllivesmatter.world/tree/main/ptools/human_passport\">program</a> using zkVM, with the code stored in the same repository as the advocacy materials. While I don't want to focus on the details here,  I want to emphasize a crucial point I realized from this exercise in the context of DUKI distribution: Blockchain technology, initially conceived to bring decentralization, foster freedom, and resolve issues of distrust, paradoxically needs both \"true authorities\" and freedom in reality to reach its full potential. These true authorities, empowered by people and serving for people, are essential. They must always respect freedom of speech. And when faced with criticism, they must do whatever work is necessary to resolve mistrust, never resorting to censorship or inaction. To truly bring the sunshine of blockchain technology into the real world, we must look beyond technology alone. I sincerely hope that all kinds of technologists - from enthusiasts to skeptics - could put more efforts into this and also help build the DUKI system."

While it's impossible to name everyone and everything, I'd like to acknowledge some key influences: Donald Trump's call for \"I want everyone to stop dying,\" Tommee Profitt's rendition of \"O come, O come, Omeemsu,\" and the BLM movement's slogan \"Black Lives Matter\" (too) have been key inspirations. The evolutionary discoveries by Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins, and Robert Axelrod laid the groundwork underpinning this advocacy. \"Freedom as the right to say no\" and \"Freedom as the power to say no\" inspired 'DUKI In Action'. These freedom concepts have roots in both historical minds like George Orwell and contemporary thinkers, such as Karl Widerquist. While the former is a truth to uphold, the latter addresses a practical challenge: what if exercising this right becomes unaffordable under unjust rule? As the saying goes, 'When the wicked rule, the people groan.' Thus, DUKI helps to empower all lives to say no to the unrighteous. Avi Wigderson's \"Everything that can be proven at all can be proven in zero knowledge\" highlights the DUKI system's technological plausibility, with blockchain innovations like zkVM and Worldcoin's WorldID further backing it up. I sincerely hope all these blockchain-related innovations will be used or evolved to make the DUKI system a reality, leaving countries that serve the people no excuse to refuse it.

                    "I also want to confess that I'm trying to piggyback on free tiers of services like Zoho, Canva, X, GitHub, and Cloudflare, which don't require immediate payment for essential usage. Even though these companies excel at their services and have shown initial kindness through their free tiers, I still won't upgrade to premium unless I see the need to, given the limited resources of an ordinary person. While kindness doesn't always guarantee reciprocation, and too many individuals taking advantage could potentially corrupt such generosity, violating the principle that 'kindness begets kindness', I sincerely hope those with means and a concern for freedom will prefer these generous companies when choosing between comparable options. If they meet both needs and budget, why not support them? They may primarily focus on marketing, but they actually support freedom in practice. Looking ahead, I sincerely hope the DUKI system becomes a reality, empowering everyone to support companies that excel at their offerings and also spread kindness, without the hesitation and second thoughts I've experienced."

Is all the information on the passport trustworthy now? Well, some is believable now, while some requires more work to make it trustworthy. For the trustworthy parts: my contact email is true, and the following claim is true - the secret I used (which I won't disclose, of course) contains my nickname, and before it, there's 'ordinary'. Regarding the 'ordinary' part, even without official authority, you can judge from my HireMeAsAmbassador ad below, but remember, even if I am ordinary, my words and actions still matter; all lives matter, don't they?. The other parts of info in my passport, such as whether I used my real name and real iris data, aren't fully trustworthy without authorities to back them up. However, I believe that through advocacy, hard work, and drawing more attention to legitimate authorities and developing more reliable ones, we can make it fully trustworthy. By 'authority' I mean entities that respond to criticism with transparency and additional proof, rather than censorship or inaction. Combining trustworthy authorities with currently available or emerging technologies, I believe we can establish a solid Web3 foundation for humanity in the coming years. In that world, All lives will have equal opportunities to grow towards their own unique potential, flourishing in all their diversity, and enabling all to achieve their own unique excellence.",

I invite you to consider me as a remote, independent ambassador. I ask you to evaluate me solely on my merits and potential contributions, regardless of nationality, color, background, beliefs, or any other factors. I'm committed to promoting your hard work and kindness to the world. Note: By 'independent,' I mean I maintain the freedom to occasionally promote other DUKI-friendly companies if more appear, but I wouldn't promote your direct competitors unless I quit. Here are a few ordinary facts about me: My primary work experience is Java-based and business-oriented, and I have no work experience in blockchain technology as yet. I learn most things driven by curiosity. While English isn't my first language, and I hardly speak it in daily life, I can understand it quite well and often catch myself thinking in English.

The source code is released under 'DUKI LICENSE', which is essentially the same as the MIT license with an additional condition: if you're using the code as a profit-making entity and your entity turns a profit, you should donate 2.5% to DUKI.

In the future, if possible, I'll try to bootstrap one or more tiny DUKIGEs, though currently I have no idea what they would be like. I won't accept donations or intend to commercialize this advocacy for personal gain, now or in the future. Moreover, please don't expect too much from me – I'm just an ordinary person with a challenging life to maintain.

                    "When I first started working on this project, before writing the letter to The Unknown, I set the default contribution percentage for the DUKI license at 1%. I chose this because I thought of 1 as the starting point, like how we count from zero. However, I later discovered that 2.5% is a commonly used figure in similar contexts. So, I decided to update the DUKI default to 2.5% to align with this practice. Initially, I promised myself I wouldn't make any money from it. But as I worked on refining my ideas, I realized this thinking was unwise and sinful. I was trying to act like some perfect, selfless angel, which wasn't genuine and didn't respect the value of entrepreneurship - something that's actually crucial for putting DUKI into action.",
                    "More importantly, I realized I might have been enlightened by the Unknown about what the \"original sin\" is - that basic instinct will to do whatever it needs to survive, whether good or bad. I also came to the realization that all lives matter, which means I should cherish myself just as much as all the other lives out there. I won't expect anyone out there to be that naively selfless, caring nothing about dissolving their own original sin. So I've come to terms with the idea that it's okay to profit from the work here if I truly believe in what I'm doing. It's about being fair first, then being kind - not pretending to be kind while ignoring fairness. This approach echoes the advocacy here: Kindness First, Fairness Always. Fairness is the biggest kindness, without it, kindness is just a lie.",
                    "Under the DUKI license, others are required to contribute 2.5% of profits to DUKI and keep 97.5% for themselves. I, as the core contributor, am technically exempt from this contribution and can keep 100%. However, I want to apologize for my earlier stance. To make up for it, I plan to initially keep 25% of the profits, and later reduce this to 2.5% once I feel I've made enough progress in dissolving my original survival sin. The remaining portion will be offered as profits to DUKI. This is my way of staying accountable and giving back.",
                    "I know, I know, I use a lot of words that might seem like nonsense. Maybe I will never profit from the advocacy here, but that's not the point. Here's my point: I'll never accept donations, and never do evil with it. I don't wish for money-making things from it, I'm more focused on the job. But I don't want to kill that possibility, because DUKI needs money. For now, I'm just presenting this Will as a representation of free will for free. I've put some money and a lot of kindness and care into it, I don't expect much from it. I'll always use it for good.",
                    "Looking ahead, believe it or not, I plan to advocate for creating AllLivesMatter.World in the Web3 world. That's how I envisioned DUKI in action. I hope to work in a forward-thinking, DUKI-friendly company in the Web3 space to make this happen or at least advocate for it. It's ambitious, I know, but I think it's a goal worth pursuing.",
                    "Then again, maybe I need to start by finding a great company to work for and make a living first. Sometimes you need to take care of the basics before you can change the world. That's our original sin, isn't it? The need to survive and thrive before we can focus on bigger dreams. But here's the exciting part: When DUKI is in action and becomes successful, it could change this dynamic. Even as it begins to take action, it will remind us that all lives indeed matter. Maybe at some point in the future, everyone will have the freedom to focus on bigger dreams. It's like we're setting up a system that could eventually free us all from that original sin, allowing us to think beyond mere survival and truly work towards making the world better."

I did receive some inspiration from a few great minds in high school, particularly from my physics teacher. I’m sorry to say that I haven’t been in touch with him since graduation, and I’ve never let him know how much I appreciate his guidance and inspiration.

I also learned the concepts of swarms, whose global intelligence emerged by simple units following simple rules like the evolutionary principle of survival of the fittest. I even have my web name taking inspiration from that. Anyway, these kind of knowledge and inherent curiosity prepared my mind for evolutionary thinking.",

                    "In my first year of college, I discovered a fascination with philosophy. Though I didn’t know much about it, I borrowed a book from the library written by Arthur Schopenhauer, \"Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung\" (in English, \"The World as Will and Representation\"). I was captivated and tried to think as the author did. I remember discussing the concept of Will-thing with my maybe ex-girlfriend, sitting by a warm fireplace on a snowy night. What a wonderful experience, though maybe I never kissed her, and now we are both fathers and mothers and have never contacted once.",
                    "Also, I got my first computer as a gift for college entry. Yes, that was a wonderful thing for me, a person who, until then, rarely watched TV because my family never got one, just like many others I knew. It was a fascinating thing, but sadly I never used it to learn something interesting systematically, mainly for gaming and surfing the news. I was often saddened by news headlines about coal miner accidents where many people died.",
                    "I was far away from home, and my father was an ordinary miner worker. He worked as a coal miner. Before I went to college, I went with him to the deep, dark underground and worked along with him once. It was not a modern workspace like we saw on television; it was quite raw. There were many tunnels that were dug by hand with simple tools, tunnels that barely allowed one person to crawl in. The miners would crawl into these narrow passages with their tools, dig coal, and then drag it out to reach the railway. There was no light, only a tiny lamp on their heads. All you could see was darkness, and all you could touch was coal. Under these conditions, accidents that caused deaths sometimes occurred.",
                    "I was worried about my father whenever I saw this kind of news, but luckily, though some accidents happened, my father was okay and got retired. Thank God. At that time, whenever I saw this kind of news, I hoped the world would do something to care for the miners’ safety. I emotionally commented on the news to urge people to take action, and after many tries, I realized that free will seemed powerless, the world moved as usual, and these tragedies still happened quite often nowdays. I was an angry youth, furious at everyone’s indifference.",
                    "But during my third year, I took a literature elective course and became fascinated by a regionalist writer. The author just described people as they were, with humanity and understanding. Maybe affected by this free will, and after some reflection, I realized that my mother and father were just like the indifferent people I was angry at. They didn’t care about these complex issues; sometimes they enjoyed hatred war movies, gaining a sense of pride when our nation won in the movies. They didn’t care about politics that much, and maybe deep in their minds and experiences they believed not all lives matter that much, and they saw themselves among those who didn’t matter. They just wanted to live their lives and take care of their children, hoping that their children would get a proper education and live a not-that-hard life, and that’s it. They had kind hearts and were good to their neighbors, unless some realistic conflicts arose, just like the neighbors did. Many times they cared about partiality over totality, maybe because they didn’t have the wisdom to discern right from wrong, or maybe that’s the nature of free will, always wanting to join together with the free will of similar people, I think it maybe that could be explained better by the selfish gene theory.",
                    "After this realization, I was no longer that angry anymore. I understood there was always a reason behind the tragic events that happened, perhaps viewing them as conflicts of free will using Arthur Schopenhauer’s thinking. Maybe some of those people never had proper education, or they may never have felt much kindness from the world except from a few family members; some didn’t even get love from their family and most probably, they might have experienced significant hostility and hardship from the world. They could have great talents, potential, and acquired wisdom, but unfortunately, the world rarely gave them the opportunity to cultivate these. They just needed to blindly do anything that could ensure their survival. There was always a reason. It is not purely their fault to blame; the constant struggle against hostility and adversity could have shaped their perspectives and actions. And probably, I wouldn’t do better than them if I had lived the lives they lived, facing the hostilities they faced. The free will of goodness may never get the freedom to fully grow.",
                    "Anyway, I just felt a hint of the world’s coldness, but I still did not fully experience the merciless reality out there. My parents shielded me from much of it, and I remained a relatively carefree youth. I lived happily for four years with my roommates, building deep friendships. That was really one of the happiest moments in my life.",
                    "Time to graduate, I still did not know what to do. I didn’t have enough knowledge to decide. I was curious about how the mind works. Deep in the night, some words emerged from my mind, one word after another. (Yes, before that time, LLM was not a thing like it is currently now) I wondered if human minds are determined or not. Is there a probability that, given certain circumstances including previous situations of mind and body, we can predict what our next word and deed will be? As an afterthought, this kind of thinking is similar to how LLMs work, as I currently learned. It also relates to my mother’s epilepsy. I wondered, a few times, why she goes into a near-unconscious state, moving instinctively and saying caring and loving words to her boy. (Sorry, Mom; your love for me is so selfless and God-like. You are truly one of the people I cherish most, and maybe your love is the real reason I want the world to be kinder and nicer to people like you.) Only later did I find out that this behavior is triggered by electrotherapy, which is unsuitable for people with epilepsy, yet was recommended without conscience by profit-driven salesmen who hinted it was beneficial for everyone in any situation.",
                    "Anyway, driven by curiosity about how the brain works, I tried to choose a graduate advisor who studied neuroscience. However, after spending some time learning and working with a doctor in the same lab, I found that their research was too simple to satisfy my inquisitive mind. Additionally, a senior doctoral colleague, who was planning to leave the research field to become a medical doctor, advised me to think seriously about my career path. Ultimately, I decided not to pursue that route. Instead, I chose an easier path and continued my studies in ecology but quit after about a year to work outside academia",
                    "Although I didn’t continue my studies in ecology, the knowledge I gained made me accustomed to thinking in ecological and evolutionary way. Darwin’s concept of survival of the fittest revealed hard truths about the universe. The idea of the selfish gene illuminated the reality that we should never assume others are angels and explained how selfish love and hate can make sense. It also showed why we should strive for peace, as destroying each other would be counterproductive causing all genes to be lost. The evolution of cooperation and the conflicts arising from selfishness, such as those in sexual selection, could actually give rise to angelic behavior in humans — those who prioritize kindness and always strive for fairness.",
                    "Anyway, after quitting, I struggled to find a junior job in the tech sector. I learned the Spring framework and about transactions that are atomic — once done, they never roll back, so we must be careful and ensure all necessary effects are in place for the commit. I worked hard from early 9 to late 9 and sometimes six days a week just to support my family and maintain my independence. I felt the reality of the world that was always there; it was a tough and inspiring experience. Life is not easy, especially for ordinary people. The world outside their family and friends does not offer much kindness to most. The world cares more about competition and profit; some compete for excellence, but most do so just for survival and profit. Companies and bosses are also subject to the harsh, objective rules of survival of the fittest. Those that don’t rely on government relationships must maintain high efficiency to maximize their chances of survival in the merciless Darwinian business world. They need to make profits to survive, which can lead them to push harder on ordinary employees to achieve this.",
                    "Almost everyone and every organization competes to be the fittest. It’s quite an eye-opening experience. All entities face challenges; they each have different battles to confront, whether you’re an ordinary worker, a company, or a millionaire looking to multiply your profits. They all adhere to the rule of survival of the fittest. This kind of competitiveness can sometimes make us forget what we’re truly competing for, leading to a lack of kindness and even to evil behavior. My mother worked day and night during her younger days; she has grown old but is not entitled to a pension that she should get to support her survival. Universal kindness is not that common in our modern society.",
                    "For me, the situation was better than in her days, although I was occupied with work, I still had some spare time. I sometimes wished I could find more meaning in it instead of just making money and competing for survival. During my spare time, I maintained the habit of absorbing wisdom from MOOCs and MOOC-like resources. I treated it as an opportunity for free will exploration; some resources had practical utility, while others were simply for curiosity.",
                    "During my exploration, I learned about bitcoins and bought some at a very early stage. However, I missed out on a significant fortune because I sold before it skyrocketed. I’m excited about WorldID and Worldcoin, even though I lost some money when Worldcoin dropped from 5 to 1 and my account got banned by their official team on X due to my advocacy for \"all lives matter world\". I took a few MOOCs and watched some videos to try to understand how the magic works. Through this experience, I learned about what decentralization is and how it is unstoppable — though I don’t know much about the technical details yet. I sensed that it could be a way for the world where all lives truly matter, even for those in the shadows like me. Yes, 'all lives matter worldwide' is the truth the world should uphold. It is not just duty, kindness, and care for all lives worldwide; it’s also a superpower for everyone. Holding it, everyone has the power to demand that they be treated with fairness.",
                    "About a year ago, in 2023, the company decided to cut jobs, and I was one of them. I received a pension and took a break. I thought to myself, should I continue without a break, or maybe take some time off (how about one gap year) to do something that satisfies my free will? Better yet, could I find a way to do both — satisfy my free will and make a living at the same time? So, I went on tour, did some other things, and built an English learning app. I finished it and published it, but at the time of writing, I’m pretty sure no more than 100 people have downloaded my app. I knew nothing about marketing and was really bad at it.",
                    "During that marketing time, I came across Trump’s interview where he said, \"I want everyone to stop dying; they are dying.\" This call resonated deeply with me. I remembered the worry I felt about my father and the despair I experienced during my college years when I saw news about miners dying. I witnessed this brave and compassionate heart being attacked and humiliated, labeled as a coward and puppet by those with evil intentions or indifference. Rather than stand by uselessly, I decided to take action as an ordinary human who believes that all lives should matter and also that all lives do matter. I wanted to join the fight; I wanted to fight with humanity and fight for peace. That’s how this advocacy was born. I just wish for peace for everyone.",
                    "During the advocacy’s initial phase, I composed the 9 letters except the one for God. Last night, my X account was blocked. I can’t log in and was locked out. I’m reading about it on reddit; it says 24 hours and some say 3 days. I wish it will be okay. I can feel Elon Musk's free will and his respect for others’ free will, but he doesn’t have the power or right to make everyone obey his will.",
                    "During that sleepless night, the poem about free will came to my mind, and I prompted it and it was born. Really, I truly enjoy it, a zero-proof that God may prove its existence to me. I am worried more about the free will seed getting killed. The worries extend to Cloudflare too. What if the company decides to take it down? I suddenly thought of the Web3 domain name. It’s better to put it on blockchain and make it more censorship-resistant, so I bought alllivesmatterworld.eth (the alllivesmatter.eth was already taken) and kindkang.eth, also alllivematterworld.unstoppable and a other domains.",
                    "I will finish the letters to God as soon as possible and try to put the website on alllivesmatterworld.unstoppable, and then actively seek a Web3 job, hoping to get hired by a great company to make a living. My wife sometimes pretends to be angry at my apparent unwillingness to actively seek jobs due to my focus on the advocacy. Initially, I argued, \"How could you not respect this good free will? Look at what I’m doing.\" Later, I found it amusing. What does \"fairness always\" really mean? Certainly, she has a right to demand fairness and be angry — after all, don’t all lives matter? She has already shown me so much kindness and love. I should respond to her kindness with kindness, not exploit or take advantage of it. I must fulfill my duties as a husband. (please don’t misunderstand, my family is not poor, just financially ordinary). Also, the promise of a one-year gap for my free will satisfaction is almost complete. \"Fairness Always\" — I’ve found real peace in this realization, and I hope I always remember it.",
                    "After this realization and the emergence of NFT ideas during the Web3 domain registration process, I've decided to modify some of the promises I made in the advocacy repository. Originally, I promised that I wouldn’t accept donations or attempt to commercialize this advocacy for personal gain, now or in the future. However, considering that all lives matter and all lives must follow the harsh rule of survival of the fittest, which may have been established by God, pretending to be a selfless angel and expecting others to do the same is both immoral and sinful. That’s not the right path. This promise is too restrictive and doesn’t recognize the value of entrepreneurship or encourage innovation.",
                    "I’ve decided to shift to a DUKI-95 model, where 95% of the profits will be distributed to all humans. While respecting the DUKI license, core contributors and the initial team will be exempt from this rule, allowing them to retain 100% of their profits. However, considering the bold and naïve promise I made earlier, I seek forgiveness from God for breaking it. To atone for my mistake, I will only take 1% of the profits, while 99% will go towards DUKI, in the hope that this will further support the advocacy. This 1% for DUKI could also be the default starting point for any serious business venture out there. After all, everything starts with 1 — the first number after 0, much like in 'O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.'  I hope someday it could stand and survive in the Darwinian world while also spreading kindness.",
                    "As this journey of reflection comes to a close, I am compelled to acknowledge and express my gratitude. I want to say to the people who have shown kindness to me, whether I've met  or not—be it family, inspiring teachers, friends, or just inspiring minds and MOOC educators—thank you.

Whether one chooses to be child-free, consumes pornography, engages in intimacy with somebody or something without love, be gay, lesbian, or transgender, or opts for abortion before new life or free will becomes conscious — these decisions carry neither shame nor glory for humanity, provided they harm no one. Such choices simply reflect living authentically and being true to oneself. They deserve respect or tolerance, as they are personal expressions of individual autonomy. We all should be proud to the the harmless true self.",

Fairness should always be used to resolve conflicts and help guide those lost in hate toward something better. FairnessAlways and KindnessFirst are the compass that lets free will de evil and evolve.

                    "Saturday holds a special place in many traditions, including Christianity, which emphasizes the importance of companionship on this day. As I accompanied my son to his roller skating class today, watching him learn with enthusiasm, I found myself reflecting on deeper meanings of this companionship practice. This wisdom transcends space, time, and religions: regardless of our ambitions or responsibilities, we should always prioritize some time with family. It's a universal best practice that doesn't require religious affiliation. Being to Actions, after all, speak much louder than symbolizing with words. In today's world, it's easy to say we adhere to beliefs, but how do we truly be the beliefs and prove that there is something like love inside the beliefs? After all, love can never be touched or seen and verified using ordinary science. We can only prove our free will's love and its existence using zero-knowledge proof consistently - by accompanying the lives of our loved ones and cherishing them.",
                    "After the lesson, there's a game for all the kids learning roller skating. It's a survival of the fittest game - the classic and popular musical chairs game. Here's how it works: Small chairs are set up, but there aren't enough for everyone. The children circle around the chairs while the teacher plays music. When the music stops, they must quickly find a chair to sit on. Each child can only occupy one chair, and no chair can seat two kids. There are always fewer chairs than children, so some will not survive and inevitably be left out",
                    "As I watched, I saw parallels to life's broader 'survival of the fittest' dynamic. Ideally, the kids should compete enthusiastically like in the game even as they grow up, focusing intensely on the present moment to secure their place. Those who don't 'survive' each round could also remain joyful, understanding they are all in love. They are the beliefs that they are all loved and the game is just a pure form of competition - striving to excel, but without dire consequences for those who don't make it. But in reality, many of us as parents hold different beliefs that competition is all about defeating others for ourselves to survive, or survive better, where failure is inevitably associated with bad things. Since the world do not love the ego, the ego should also not love the world. We embody these beliefs inevitably in the current world - we are shaped by our parents and by the beliefs of people worldwide, which have shaped the harsh reality of the world. Think about the people who can't pay for housing because of job loss, think of those who are starving and struggling at the basic survival level, think about the innocents who have died and are dying in mass conflicts like wars - if they do not hold these beliefs, they can hardly survive.",
                    "This prompted me to reflect on the possibility of 'DUKI in Action' again: could our world adopt a similar approach? One where we compete and evolve, but failure doesn't spell catastrophe? Where even those who don't 'survive' a round face no severe consequences and are still free to reject evil and do good?",
                    "In contrast, our current world often falls short of this ideal. If you lose your job or your business fails, you may struggle to afford food, shelter, and other necessities - then free will is not truly free anymore and can easily fall into that sin.",
                    "The same applies to any organization too. I saw an example where a church asked a popular star to perform a concert inside the Church, maybe it is struggling with the original sin of survival too. I was on social media, where I believe a certain percentage of accounts exist without genuine human intent, their existence merely to satisfy financial motives, mostly marketing, also some kind of evil like fake bot accounts or those used to promote unsavory activities.",
                    "Thinking about people and organizations around me, it seems that all lives and all organizations are born with that original sin - they must be able to survive first, then may gain the wisdom and power to reject evil, do good and spread love. This may indeed be the case, as many religious texts and philosophies speak of being born with sin or needing to overcome suffering, acknowledging that life is hard. Perhaps the key is to engage with life's challenges through love, ensuring our survival without compromising our morality. The ideal would be a world where, even if one doesn't 'survive as fittest” in the game of life - losing a job or facing business failure - they still live in freedom and can freely spread love instead of hatred.",
                    "On our way home, my son surprised me with an unexpected topic: <a class='speaker1'>Dad, my classmate are going to travel to foreign countries,</a> he said excitedly. After a few exchanges, I asked, <a class='speaker0'>Oh? Which country would you like to visit when you grow up?</a> <a class='speaker1'>America!</a> he replied without hesitation. Curious, I probed further. <a class='speaker0'>Why America?</span> <a class='speaker1'>Because they have hamburgers,</a> he answered matter-of-factly. He enjoys watching the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants. Amused by his reasoning, I continued, <a class='speaker0'>Would you want to become an American if you could?</a>,<a class='speaker1'>I want to, because there are easy hamburgers every day,</a> he said with conviction. Pretending to be angry, I exclaimed, <a class='speaker0'>What? What's wrong with our own nation? Your daddy was born here and love the people here and is a potrait! Why would you want to be American?</a>, <a class='speaker1'>Because I can eat hamburgers,</a> he replied simply.<a class='speaker0'>You want to become American just because of hamburgers?</a> I asked, incredulous., <a class='speaker1'>Yes, they eat them every day like it's easy,</a> he insisted. Shaking my head in amusement, I suggested, <a class='speaker0'>Okay, today let's buy some hamburgers out there. Will you still want to be American?</a> His response was immediate:<a class='speaker1'>Oh no, I don't want to anymore.</a> <a class='speaker0'>Alright, let's go buy some hamburgers then,</a> I offered, but to my surprise, he refused. <a class='speaker0'>Grandma wouldn't be happy,</a> he added thoughtfully. <a class='speaker0'>She thinks they're much too 'hot' and not healthy.</a>",
                    "This innocent exchange led me to reflect on immigration and global inequality again. It reinforced the soundness of DUKI in action. Perhaps we could offer 'hamburgers' to everyone, actually solving the immigration problem and dissolving all lives' original sin. This could be driven by humanity's natural kindness, guided by religious teachings, chosen through free will, or simply exist as a fundamental right. If we truly believe all lives matter, shouldn't we - as part of the all - do what matters to create a world where DUKI is in action to remind all lives of the existence of universal kindness and their duty to empower all lives to have the freedom to reject evil, do good and make more love for the world? Perhaps we could Make All Great Again (MAGA?).",
                    "Always remember, DUKI is an option, not an obligation. It's a free will choice for those with love, and a way to prove the existence of love inside your beliefs. As the Bible says, 'Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.'",
                    "Personally, I found DUKI in action feels so scientifically sound when used as a niche marketing strategy. It plays so nicely with evolution of the fittest and the willed 'all lives matter worldwide' beliefs. It seems a gift from the Unknown, if implemented together with a fully zero-knowledge proof human passport on blockchain.",
                    "Also, let me remind you of other coincidences here. What is the first impression that comes to your mind when you first encounter the symbol 'DUKI'? Is it 'dookie'? It may be the same for many minds who think of SHIT when they see ALM and AllLivesMatterWorld because of the historical controversy there. But they are not. These symbols should not be abandoned just because evil was once associated with them. All symbols can be used and associated with evil; can we abandon all symbols? Actually, the symbols were originally invented as a kind reminder, maybe from the Unknown. They are duty, kindness, and cookie combined. We should never let them become #TheLostSymbol. The things that should be abandoned like DOOKIE are the evil interpretations of the symbols, not the symbols themselves which could be used to host good.",

The advocacy originally stemmed from an ecological-evolutionary perspective, but it was mysteriously guided or enlightened by the Unknown and evolved its representation/manifestation using Christian symbols. This experience opened my eyes and made me fully aware and in awe of that Unknown out There.",
                    "Perhaps influenced by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, I have become accustomed to interpreting science and religious texts beyond symbols, focusing on the will they represent. I find many sayings convey the same idea, for example: 'The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, The name that can be named is not the eternal Name' or 'Neti Neti' (Sanskrit: नेति नेति), 'וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים אֶל־מֹשֶׁה אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה וַיֹּאמֶר כֹּה תֹאמַר לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶהְיֶה שְׁלָחַנִי אֲלֵיכֶם׃', 'And God said to Moses, I Am Who I Am and What I Am, and I Will Be What I Will Be; and He said, You shall say this to the Israelites: I Am has sent me to you!'. There is science in this: people around the world use different languages and words to represent the same wills, rules, or unknowns. For example, Newton's three laws of motion were written down as a record in the Vaisheshika Sutra: (वेगः निमित्तविशेषात कर्मणो जायते) | (वेगः निमित्तापेक्षात कर्मणो जायते नियतदिक क्रियाप्रबन्धहेतु) | (वेगः संयोगविशेषविरोधी) |. Although these representations are different, they all symbolize the same will.",
                    "If there is a Holy Unknown out there, we must transcend symbols to find His existence. Religious texts may be the best practice to find it, but there are many ways. For me, having never received any Christian teachings, I think I sometimes felt Him and thought I felt His Will—AllLivesMatterWorld is His Will. To be frank, I do not know, because I still think in ordinary scientific terms and I feel the possibility of His existence out there, but I know nothing about His Existence scientifically. Maybe He is always providing zero-knowledge enlightenment for me; I always gain zero knowledge about Him.",
                    "I tend to believe, but another voice raises doubts. Maybe He really set our free will free and let it be.",
                    "Anyway, I tend to believe, but I'm not certain, that the Bible is Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth from the Unknown, primarily about how to love and the wisdom to light or guide our free will to love and to evolve, instead of being lost in darkness and twisting love into hate. To be honest, I was initially confused by phrases like \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me,\" the same way I was confused about Islam's literal text like \"And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\" (Quran 3:85). When two people with different beliefs meet and interpret these literally, it can lead to conflict instead of fostering understanding and spreading love.",
                    "Does He will us to fall into these conflicts? My free will doesn't think so. It seems more likely that Jesus or the teachings of Islam symbolize Love. If we frame it this way and treat that symbol the same as Love, it makes more sense: \"Love is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Love\" and \"This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Love as religion.\" Many religious texts focus on love, both for oneself and for others.",
                    "There are many symbols that may seem to spread hate at first glance, like in the Bible, Leviticus 20:13 (NIV): \"If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\" and also in Quran 4:89 (Sahih International): \"They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.\" My free will cannot feel love or fairness behind those symbols. Instead, it felt evil hidden behind. My way of judging whether it is evil/unrighteous or good/righteous is simple: Since all free wills matter worldwide, any free will that brings no harm or better spreads love should be respected or tolerated. All free wills that bring harm to spread hate are evil. It's quite hard to define harm; may all guide with love to find that out. ",
                    "Another harmless interpretation: those symbols could only mean something in our spiritual world, like in the game Plants vs. Zombies, you kill the undead free will to using sunflowers love help them evolve. Or another interpretation: Is it possible that The Unknown unbinds our free will and makes it so just to test if our free will can truly make a righteous judgment here, as said in 'You shall judge the people with righteous judgment. You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality, and you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of the righteous.'",
                    "I've also pondered the saying, \"But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also,\" especially in the context of bullies or wars, like Russia vs. Ukraine or Hamas vs. Israel. Should the one being slapped not fight back? I tend to believe that He wills Love as forgiveness in this situation. He doesn't imply we shouldn't strive for fairness or value lives being slapped. Instead, we should respond with justice, together with forgiveness. The greatest love for all lives should be upheld through fairness always, using kindness to promote more love rather than hate. I really find harmony in other sayings like \"And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them. Whoever sows generously will also reap generously...... But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise\" and also \"And when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin, I will remember my covenant... and I will forgive their sin.\"",
                    "My interpretation of these symbols centers on the will I felt and advocated: that all lives matter worldwide. I approached the Bible with this understanding, perhaps leading me to read it righteously or unrighteously, I do not know. But I know that if His will indeed exists, we better not interpret religious texts to introduce conflicts and spread hate; instead, we should transcend symbols and focus on our words and deeds to spread love and elevate all. Because love is the way, and there is also a possibility that all of these symbols or words are just different manifestations/representations of the Unknown's Will about Love.",
                    "I recognize my understanding is limited as an ordinary person, but I'm open to others' interpretations as long as they contain wisdom about love inside—not just for ourselves, but for others. Enlighten me, if you have better interpretations; I am willing to evolve my free will."
