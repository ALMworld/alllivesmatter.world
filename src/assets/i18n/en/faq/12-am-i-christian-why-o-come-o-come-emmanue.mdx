I am not a Christian, nor do I claim to be one. I'm unfamiliar with what religious texts say about God or Christ, as I grew up and was educated in an environment without any religious teachings, including Christianity. I have very limited exposure to Christian activities and other religious activities. At the time of writing, I have not attended any church services for worship, though I've visited a few churches as a tourist.

However, I still choose to use the word 'God' in a way that transcends specific religions. To me, it represents the collective positive influences shaping our world and our shared potential for good—something no single person or organization could achieve alone. This concept embodies humanity's capacity for kindness, our drive to improve, and the power of our combined efforts to create positive change. I see it as symbolizing the inherent goodness within people and the strength we find when uniting for a common purpose. 'God' encompasses the interconnected web of positive actions and ideas that uplift us all, even if we can't precisely articulate their source or impact. I hope this interpretation doesn't offend or contradict others' understanding of the term.

As a non-native English speaker living in a non-English-speaking country -- which I'd rather not specify due to the foreseeable biases or evil that could be imposed on me  -- I ask you to treat me as a person from a country you might consider most hostile. Despite this, I assert that hostility does not speak my free will. I sincerely hope you treat all perspectives critically, including claims I make here and the advocacy itself. As a single person initializing the AllLivesMatter.World advocacy, I could never have completed this without God's help (My Limited Understanding, 'God' = 'Goodness of Humanity'.). This encompasses the kindness I've received from my family, friends, and others; the knowledge and growth I've gained through MOOCs and other educational experiences; the wisdom of great minds, both present and historical, easily accessible through the internet and AI language models; and all the positive influences that have shaped my understanding and character. The manifestation of AllLivesMatter.World is something no single individual could ever achieve alone, yet it's present in our collective humanity. I credit all of this to 'God'.

I'm pretty much tone-deaf and know next to nothing about music. I came across the song accidentally one night while working on AllLivesMatter.World. It was playing as background music from my wife's TikTok-like video feed. The moment I heard it, I got it. I searched for its name, sensing a great goodness within it, even though the video content and comments didn't fully reflect it. Some comments expressed fear, with people admitting they dared not listen further. But I still felt the vast goodness inside the song.

Finally, I located the Tommee Profitt <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQuq4umpb3Q' target='new' className='inline_ref'>masterpiece</a> on YouTube and learned its name: 'O Come, O Come, Emmanuel'. I've been listening to it day and night. There are indeed haunting sounds and a sense of dark power in it, yet there is far more goodness. I hear the clash of swords, the roars of demons, and the cries of innocents. I hear the sounds of mass conflicts and wars, but these are overlaid with angels singing and praying for the soldiers fighting against the powerful evil. It echoes the sounds of the world we're in - the rattle of gunfire as soldiers fight, the explosions of artillery, and the fervent prayers for peace rising above the chaos. These sounds resonate from conflict zones like Israel and Palestine, Russia and Ukraine, and other regions trapped in struggles initiated by malevolent forces. It is the sound of innocents suffering, yet also singing and praying for the soldiers fighting evil, believing they will win - and win big - to bring peace and joy to all the world.

I felt the presence of 'God' again, and I am certain more than ever that I needed to spread this message out by initiating the global call for peace, especially to those with power, whether empowered by people or earned through their merit and works. By embracing kindness, fairness, and DUKI, we can resolve these massive conflicts, achieve peace, and prevent similar tragedies from happening.

There is evil within humanity, which sometimes manifests its true nature fully through actions that cause hurt, death, and destruction. We see this in acts of violence, war, and deliberate cruelty. But beyond these obvious manifestations, evil also lurks hidden in the shadows of our collective consciousness. It permeates across all colors, nationalities, sexes, and different religions - in every group we might define.

But sisters and brothers, let's recognize the true nature of our real enemies. It's not entire groups of people, but rather the individuals who choose to do evil, whether by causing overt harm or through more subtle means. This includes those who pervert justice through partiality, bribery. As it is written, 'You shall judge the people with righteous judgment. You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality, and you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of the righteous.'

Evil manifests in actions that undermine undermine kindess and fairness, favoring some over others based on prejudice or personal gain. It can hide behind institutions, ideologies, or even well-intentioned policies. Our true adversaries are not our sisters and brothers of different nationalities, colors, or beliefs, but rather those who choose to act unjustly, regardless of their background or the guise under which they operate.

Recognizing this hidden evil is the first step in combating it. We must remain vigilant, not only against obvious wrongdoing but also against the subtle corruption of principles that can lead us astray from the path of true justice and kindness. By embodying kindness, fairness, and DUKI, let 'O Come, O Come, Emmanuel' be our rallying cry, We can make 'God' win, and win big.
