Open source contributors are so smart and so generous. They have driven innovation worldwide with numerous creations,whether it's the operating system Linux, the widely used database SQLite, or React, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and countless others. These innovators have shared their creations so generously,  using open licenses like MIT, Apache, or GPL, hoping everyone can benefit. Even when large companies generate millions or billions from these projects, the contributors never ask for anything in return. The world has indeed benefited greatly from their kindness and hard work!

Sometimes I wonder if they could be a bit more 'selfish' - not for themselves, but for the countless people who are less fortunate and left behind by the world. I'm thinking of those living in extreme poverty, struggling daily for basic necessities like food, clean water, and shelter. Or the millions of children lacking access to education, and the refugees displaced by conflicts and natural disasters. Additionally, there are workers displaced by technological advancements, such as taxi drivers affected by autonomous vehicles or factory workers replaced by automation. Even more concerning are those whose lives are negatively impacted by the misuse of certain technologies - invasions of privacy, and potential infringements on their civil liberties. These are people who often don't have the means to directly benefit from technological progress, let alone contribute to it.

What if new, emerging, or even legacy open-source projects released their potentially groundbreaking work with a DUKI-friendly license? This could be either a new 'DUKI[-n] License' or traditional licenses with a 'DUKI[-n] Required' clause, where 'n' represents the percentage of profit to be contributed (preferably with n between 1-5, defaulting to 1 as it's a natural starting point). Under this model, companies using DUKI-licensed projects and generating profit would be required to contribute a small percentage of their earnings towards fostering universal kindness. If they haven't made a profit, everything would remain the same as with current licenses. It's worth noting that the companies behind the creators and main maintainers of these open-source projects would be exempt from this requirement, though they could always choose to contribute voluntarily. Their act of releasing and maintaining the project as open-source is already a significant contribution, often involving substantial effort and resources. And we should reward kindness with kindness, making these companies more competitive for engaging in such generous acts. As the saying goes again, 'Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.'

This is just my wildest imagination, of course. With or without a DUKI version, open source contributors are still as great as ever.
