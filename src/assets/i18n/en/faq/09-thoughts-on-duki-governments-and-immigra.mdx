If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. -- James Madiso

The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. -- Thomas Jefferson

The health of a democratic society may be measured by the quality of functions performed by private citizens. -- Alexis de Tocqueville

Legal immigration should always be facilitated for those who can build reciprocity, responding to the initial kindness of entry. This echoes the old saying, 'Open the gates and let a righteous, faith-filled people enter in.'  With the help of DUKI system, some fruits of immigrants' hard work can slowly flow back to their countries of origin, spreading kindness to the lands they once called home. This approach aligns with the principles of Kindness, Fairness, and Dukiness. However, illegal immigration, especially on a massive scale, cannot be condoned. There is not a single excuse for allowing it to happen, as it brings conflicts instead of reciprocity. It is like a silent war orchestrated by some dark power, that will bring suffering and injury to innocents on both sides, whether in local communities or among the immigrants themselves

Governments that believe in 'All Lives Matter Worldwide' are specially suited to champion 'DUKI in action'. DUKI serves as a powerful reminder that 'all lives matter worldwide' is not just a truth to uphold, but a principle to live by—emphasizing that every life's words and deeds matter. Through DUKI, these forward-thinking governments can foster a global community where reciprocity flourishes, creating a more harmonious future. By distributing DUKI worldwide, they send a strong signal to the world that there is goodness in humanity. There are places that will 'Open the gates and let a righteous, faith-filled people enter in.' Those places also remain vigilant in maintaining this system's integrity, ensuring that "Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful."

Governments and DUKI, both by PEOPLE and for PEOPLE. They both rely on true authority, true authority that always should respond to criticism with transparency and additional proof, rather than censorship or inaction. DUKI is calling upon Governments: NO TAX ON DUKI or even lowering taxes on DUKIGEN!
