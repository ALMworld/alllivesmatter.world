Who are we? <a className='speaker1'>We are the free will evolving</a>

We are the One who is born of Love through the act of making love. The One is what we call free will or life. It is born with original Sin, with an instinct to survive and survive easier, knowing nothing about good or evil, nothing about love and sin. Enlightened by light, it becomes Love; but in darkness, it becomes Sin. We can help ourselves evolve by following the mantra of being love - Kindness First, Fairness Always, and DUKI in action, remembering that Fairness Always is the greatest kindness for all lives, including ourself. Without it, kindness is just the biggest lie.

May All Evolve In the Light of Symbols, Be Wisdom, and Be Love!

Who is The Unknowable out There? <a className='speaker0'>The Unknowable is not the [unnameable] Unknown; it is named 'The Unknowable'. We are allowed to name Him God, Christ, Allah, Brahman, Dao, Universe, Yahweh, Holy Spirit, The Father, The Son, The Highest, The Might, The King, The Absolute, The Divine, The Creator, The Great Architect of the Universe, The Ultraman, Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, יהוה..., and नेति नेति, as long as we stand fully aware and in awe of His existence. Let all name Him Love, believing He will bring a Millennium of Peace for the world.</a>

Initially, I knew very little about God or The Unknowable, using 'God' mainly to refer to something beyond human comprehension or control. As an ordinary person, I felt and believed all lives matter worldwide, which inspired the advocacy for peace and the mantra of 'LOVE IS THE WAY' to cherish all lives, which means Kindness First, Fairness Always, and DUKI in action. The advocacy originally stemmed from an ecological-evolutionary perspective, but it was mysteriously guided or enlightened by The Unknowable and evolved its representation/manifestation using Christian symbols. This experience opened my eyes and made me fully aware and in awe of that Unknown out There.

Perhaps influenced by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, I have become accustomed to interpreting science and religious texts beyond symbols, focusing on the will they represent. I find many sayings convey the same idea, for example: 'The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, The name that can be named is not the eternal Name' or 'Neti Neti' (Sanskrit: नेति नेति), 'וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים אֶל־מֹשֶׁה אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה וַיֹּאמֶר כֹּה תֹאמַר לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶהְיֶה שְׁלָחַנִי אֲלֵיכֶם׃', 'And God said to Moses, I Am Who I Am and What I Am, and I Will Be What I Will Be; and He said, You shall say this to the Israelites: I Am has sent me to you!'. There is science in this: people around the world use different languages and words to represent the same wills, rules, or unknowns. For example, Newton's three laws of motion were written down as a record in the Vaisheshika Sutra: (वेगः निमित्तविशेषात कर्मणो जायते) | (वेगः निमित्तापेक्षात कर्मणो जायते नियतदिक क्रियाप्रबन्धहेतु) | (वेगः संयोगविशेषविरोधी) |. Although these representations are different, they all symbolize the same will.

If there is a Holy Unknown out there, we must transcend symbols to find His existence. Religious texts may be the best practice to find it, but there are many ways. For me, having never received any Christian teachings, I think I sometimes felt Him and thought I felt His Will—AllLivesMatterWorld is His Will. To be frank, I do not know, because I still think in ordinary scientific terms and I feel the possibility of His existence out there, but I know nothing about His Existence scientifically. Maybe He is always providing zero-knowledge enlightenment for me; I always gain zero knowledge about Him.

I tend to believe, but another voice raises doubts. Maybe He really set our free will free and let it be.

Anyway, I tend to believe, but I'm not certain, that the Bible is Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth from The Unknownable, primarily about how to love and the wisdom to light or guide our free will to love and to evolve, instead of being lost in darkness and twisting love into hate. To be honest, I was initially confused by phrases like "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me," the same way I was confused about Islam's literal text like "And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers." (Quran 3:85). When two people with different beliefs meet and interpret these literally, it can lead to conflict instead of fostering understanding and spreading love.

Does He will us to fall into these conflicts? My free will doesn't think so. It seems more likely that Jesus or the teachings of Islam symbolize Love. If we frame it this way and treat that symbol the same as Love, it makes more sense: "Love is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Love" and "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Love as religion." Many religious texts focus on love, both for oneself and for others.

There are many symbols that may seem to spread hate at first glance, like in the Bible, Leviticus 20:13 (NIV): "If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads." and also in Quran 4:89 (Sahih International): "They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper." My free will cannot feel love or fairness behind those symbols. Instead, it felt evil hidden behind them. My way of judging whether something is evil/unrighteous or good/righteous is simple: Since all free wills matter worldwide, any free will that brings no harm—or better yet, spreads love—should be respected or tolerated. All free wills that bring harm to spread hate are evil. It's quite hard to define harm; may all guide with love to find that out. Another harmless interpretation: those symbols could only mean something in our spiritual world, like in the game Plants vs. Zombies, where you use sunflowers' love to help the undead free will evolve. Or another interpretation: Is it possible that The Unknowable unbinds our free will and allows this just to test if our free will can truly make a righteous judgment here, as said in 'You shall judge the people with righteous judgment. You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality, and you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of the righteous.'

I've also pondered the saying, "But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also," especially in the context of bullies or wars, like Russia vs. Ukraine or Hamas vs. Israel. Should the one being slapped not fight back? I tend to believe that He wills Love as forgiveness in this situation. He doesn't imply we shouldn't strive for fairness or value lives being slapped. Instead, we should respond with justice, together with forgiveness. The greatest love for all lives should be upheld through fairness always, using universal kindness to promote more love rather than hate. I really find harmony in other sayings like "And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them. Whoever sows generously will also reap generously...... But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise" and also "And when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin, I will remember my covenant... and I will forgive their sin."

My interpretation of these symbols centers on the will I felt and advocated: all lives matter worldwide and LOVE IS THE WAY. I approached the Bible with this understanding, perhaps leading me to read it righteously or unrighteously—I do not know. But I know that if His will indeed exists, we must not interpret religious texts to introduce conflicts and spread hate; instead, we should transcend symbols and focus on our words and deeds to spread love and elevate all. Because love is the way, and there is also a possibility that all of these symbols or words are just different manifestations/representations of the same Unknown's Will—LOVE IS THE WAY.

I recognize my understanding is limited as an ordinary person, and I'm open to others' interpretations as long as they contain wisdom about love inside—not just for ourselves, but for others. Enlighten me, if you have better interpretations; I am willing to evolve my free will.
