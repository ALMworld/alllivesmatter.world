As stated in the <a className='inline_ref' target='new' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c'>video</a> by Amit Sahai: 'One of my hopes is that the power of multi-party computation can bring together people who are mutually distrustful. Can we harness the power inherent in cryptography to somehow alleviate the tremendous level of mistrust?' I sincerely believe that the answer is yes. Through decentralization, blockchain can distribute power to everyone, ensuring that all participants act with kindness and fairness, ultimately benefiting all. I firmly believe that innovations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, WorldID, ZK-STARKs, zkVM, and numerous others, contributed by talented and brilliant individuals, will have valuable applications in human society in the years to come. They will benefit humanity in ways we have yet to imagine. In this context, I believe the DUKI system, kindness by all and promoting kindness for all, will be one of the first significant applications to emerge.

Creating DUKI is the easy part. DUKIGEs earn money through merit and hard work, and they're willing to spread kindness by donating part of their success to all humans. As for DUKI contributions, I believe they can largely be solved by existing blockchain technology. Each DUKIGEN could have a smart contract operating on the blockchain. These contracts would store and automatically transfer funds to distribution shard contracts to facilitate fair distribution. The total amount could be divided among 1 thousand people, then 1 million, and finally enough for all humans worldwide who are chain, allowing each to claim their DUKI when they prove their uniqueness.

The real challenge in DUKI Distribution lies in proving personhood while ensuring privacy to protect against potential targeting by malicious actors. After recently watching a <a className='inline_ref' target='new' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu_j5_tains"> 12-year-old video</a> named 'Professor Avi Wigderson on cryptography', a statement struck me: 'Everything that can be proven at all can be proven in zero knowledge - not just some things, not nothing, everything that can be proven can be proven in zero knowledge.' Does this include proving "everyone's unique existence in the world using their private unique and untakeable traits"? If true, this could truly form the foundation of the DUKI infrastructure.

Later, I realized that technology like WorldID has already demonstrated this concept, although there are concerns. The centralized storage of human iris codes could lead to potential blockage by unfriendly countries, and there are also other concerns, potentially slowing down its mass adoption. Despite these challenges, this innovative approach that gives each human a unique world ID is definitely the way to go. By incorporating more strength and decentralization, we could accelerate adoption and empower all humans in our increasingly digital world.

Is it technically possible to achieve proof of unique human existence using zero-knowledge proofs without collecting centralized iris code data? Could this be accomplished by using zero-knowledge proofs of iris data stored on local devices, similar to Apple's Optic ID 1-to-few matching approach, but dramatically scaling it up to a universal 1-to-n system<a className='inline_ref' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_rkxyw_U84&t=1535s' target='new'>&nbsp;»</a>? Could we create a unique identifier on a public blockchain without leaking any of the user's private data, so that everyone could utilize it without applying for it first, making it more widely decentralized? Furthermore, is it possible to standardize a zero-knowledge proof of user uniqueness and create a Humanity Proof RFC (Request for Comments) to make it standard, so that all manufacturers could implement it in smartphones, VR headsets, and other devices, thus truly enabling DUKI? I feel this approach, if possible, might be the fastest way to fully champion DUKI.

As someone with no practical blockchain job experience, I've imagined how a DUKI system might distribute funds using Human Passports—where each unique human gets one and only one zkp-backed privacy passport. To help think through this scenario, I created a toy  <a className='inline_ref' target='new' href="https://github.com/KindKang/alllivesmatter.world/tree/main/ptools/human_passport">program</a> using zkVM, with the code stored in the same repository as the advocacy materials. While I don't want to focus on the details here,  I want to emphasize a crucial point I realized from this exercise in the context of DUKI distribution: Blockchain technology, initially conceived to bring decentralization, foster freedom, and resolve issues of distrust, paradoxically needs both "true authorities" and freedom in reality to reach its full potential. These true authorities, empowered by people and serving for people, are essential. They must always respect freedom of speech. And when faced with criticism, they must do whatever work is necessary to resolve mistrust, never resorting to censorship or inaction. To truly bring the sunshine of blockchain technology into the real world, we must look beyond technology alone. I sincerely hope that all kinds of technologists - from enthusiasts to skeptics - could put more efforts into this and also help build the DUKI system.
