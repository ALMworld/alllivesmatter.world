Free will can be anything; nothing can stop it, as The Unknowable unbinds it. It can twist into something dark, like hatred fueling a zombie army, or bloom into something bright, like love, a sunflower powering the whole garden.

Free will can manifest as the purest expression of existence, causing no harm but perhaps concentrating too much love inward rather than sharing it with the world. Whether one chooses to be child-free, consumes pornography, engages in intimacy with somebody or something without love, is gay, lesbian, or transgender, or opts for abortion before new life or free will becomes conscious—these decisions carry neither shame nor glory for humanity, provided they harm no one. Such choices simply reflect living authentically and being true to oneself. They deserve respect or tolerance, as they are personal expressions of individual autonomy. We all should be proud to be our harmless true selves.

But when free will takes a darker turn, like the undead spreading harm and trying to snuff out the good—such as disloyalty to intimate commitments, violence, bullying, and manipulating those whose free will causes no harm, or performing late abortions on purpose after new free will becomes fully conscious—it's our duty to stand firm and fight back. Fairness should always be used to resolve conflicts and help guide those lost in hate toward something better. FairnessAlways and KindnessFirst are the compass that lets free will defeat evil and evolve. In conflicts, they should be the light that dispels the darkness and guides us.

Ultimately, the real beauty for humanity lies in this: Stand in awe of the vast Unknown, knowing there's so much beyond our understanding. Embrace and embody the belief that He wills an AllLivesMatterWorld and always wants all to live a life full of love, because we are all born of love—first by His pure love and then by us making love. Cherish love, allowing it to inspire new life and dissolve the original sin inside the free will. Live a life full of love, with various works as representations of its existence. Seek your own path to The Unknowable, whether through Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Science, or any other way that fosters respect and causes no harm. This is the sunflower way—nurturing humanity to survive and thrive, and honoring this shared journey together.

May all embrace the belief that All Lives Matter and that Love is the Way to The Unknowable.
