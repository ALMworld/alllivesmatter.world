The DUKI License is a permissive open-source license, similar to the MIT license, with one key addition: a 'Share Your Success' clause that directs [n]% of profits earned using the license back to the world as DUKI.

Initially for the advocacy, I set the contribution at 1% and vowed not to profit from it myself, seeing it as a purely selfless act. However, I came to realize this mindset was a form of sin. Pretending to be a selfless angel was disingenuous and disrespected the spirit of entrepreneurship, which is vital for bringing a project like DUKI to life.

This led to a deeper philosophical realization about the nature of 'original sin': it is the fundamental, amoral instinct to survive by any means necessary. Embracing the principle that 'all lives matter' must therefore include one's own. To deny one's own needs would be to expect a naive, unrealistic selflessness from others.

Therefore, I have come to terms with the fact that profiting from this work is acceptable, provided it is done with genuine belief and integrity and brings mutual benefits. This aligns with the project's core principle: Fairness First, Kindness Always. True kindness cannot exist without a foundation of fairness; otherwise, it is merely a pretense.

While these ideas may seem abstract, my core commitment is simple: I will never use this project for evil. Profit is not the primary driver; the mission is. However, I must leave the possibility of funding open, because the DUKI initiative will require resources to grow. For now, I offer this work freely as an expression of will. I have invested my own time, money, and care into it with modest expectations, and my pledge is to always steer it toward a positive impact.

My long-term vision is to advocate AllLivesMatter.World within the Web3 ecosystem—this is the ultimate application of the DUKI philosophy. My goal is to join a forward-thinking, DUKI-friendly company in the Web3 space to either build this vision or advocate for its creation.

Realistically, the first step may be to secure my own livelihood. One must often address basic needs before attempting to change the world—this is the practical manifestation of our 'original sin.' This is also where the power of DUKI lies. A successful DUKI ecosystem could fundamentally alter this dynamic. By creating a system that reinforces the value of all lives, it could one day provide everyone with the security to pursue their highest aspirations. The ultimate goal is to build a framework that helps free us from the constraints of mere survival, allowing humanity to focus on creating a truly better world.
