In war's merciless arena, where survival of the fittest shows its cruelest face, justice doesn't stand on its own. It's the blood and sweat of people and soldiers that give justice its strength. While I'm aware that good intentions alone won't suffice, I still send my best wishes to those fighting for justice. And I want justice to prevail because only when it is strong can our hopes, dreams, and the progress of our civilization have a firm foundation to stand on.

In the grand theater of war, the powerful orchestrate while the innocent dance with death and perish. Ideally, those orchestrating conflict should pay equally - life for life, eye for eye. But in reality, the powerful craft rules to shield themselves, exploiting the innocents and leaving them with few choices. Empowering the innocent may be our best hope to prevent mass conflict and secure peace.

Mass conflicts are black holes born from the clash of two powerful Wills,orchestrated by hidden evil. These singularities trap countless free wills in their gravitational pull, absorbing lives and causing widespread suffering. Beyond these warring voids exists a higher justice Will, aligning with the righteous and striving to eliminate the black hole and set every trapped free will free. To make a world where all lives matter, we must map these black holes' formation and escalation, pinpointing the hidden evil at their cores. Only then can we create a world where all lives truly matter.
