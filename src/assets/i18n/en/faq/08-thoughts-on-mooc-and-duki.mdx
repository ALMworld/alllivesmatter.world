In every era, freedom and common sense face four major challenges: the strongman's desire for concentrated power; the resentment of the poor towards wealth inequality; the ignorant's yearning for utopia; and the faithless conflating liberty with indulgence.

In the face of freedom's perennial foes, two champions emerge: DUKI: antidote to power-hungry tyrants and wealth gap woes. MOOC: slaying ignorance and moral decay. Together, they stand guard at freedom's gates. These guardians could protect and nurture a vision of society that resembles a vast orchard. In this orchard, the soil is rich and nourishing, and each seed of talent is planted, watered, and got ample sunshine, growing towards its own unique potential, flourishing in all its diversity, and enabling all to achieve their own unique excellence.
