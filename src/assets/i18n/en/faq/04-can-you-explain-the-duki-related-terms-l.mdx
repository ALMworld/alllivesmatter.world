DUKI (pronounced /djuːki/, reminiscent of 'duty','kindness' and 'cookie'). Think of it as 'kindness money' for everyone. It's like a global piggy bank filled by nice folks all over the world. The idea is to help people do good stuff and be kind to each other because, you know, others've already made the first move in being kind. But here's the cool part - why would people put their own money into this bank? Well, imagine this: when you chip in, you're not just giving; you're creating a world where everyone wants you to succeed even more. It's like planting seeds of goodwill everywhere. The more successful you become, the more you can contribute, and the more everyone benefits. So people aren't just hoping you do well – they're rooting for you to hit it big!

DUKIGEN (pronounced /djuːki-dʒen/).  When a business or organization decides to join the kindness party by sharing some of what they've got, they transform into something pretty cool - a DUKIGEN! It's like they put on a superhero cape, but instead of fighting bad guys, they're fighting... well, not-so-kindness, I guess? When a company says, 'Hey, we're gonna take a portion of our profits and spread it around to help folks,' - boom! They've just DUKIGEN'd themselves! Becoming a DUKIGEN can take various forms. For example, a business might commit to sharing a small part of their future success, like pledging 1% of profits once they become stable and profitable. At that point, they become a DUKIGEN. It doesn't matter what size they are - whether it's a big corporation or a small mom-and-pop shop - any type of organization can become a DUKIGEN in various ways. The cool thing is, once an organization becomes a DUKIGEN, they're part of this global network of kindness. They're not just a business anymore - they're a business with a heart, actively contributing to make the world a bit better. Remember, it's not about how much they give. Even small contributions count. As the saying goes, "Even a cup of cold water can make a difference." When a business becomes a DUKIGEN, they're saying, "We're not just here to make money - we're here to make a difference too." So next time you hear about a company sharing their success to help others, you can nod and say, "Yep, they've become a DUKIGEN. Cool move!"

DUKER (pronounced /djuːkɚ/). Hey, Have you heard about DUKER? They're pretty awesome! A DUKER is someone who's all about improving themselves, utilizing their potential to spread kindness, and making the world a bit better. It's like they've decided to be their own personal superhero, but instead of fighting bad guys, they're tackling the not-so-nice stuff in the world. The cool thing about DUKERs is that anyone can be one. You don't need superpowers or a ton of money. All you need is a big heart and the willingness to pitch in however you can. But here's the real kicker - DUKERs don't just stop there. They're always looking to level up their kindness game. They're all about learning new skills, cultivating their talents, and finding more ways to contribute, while nurturing their curiosity in parallel. It's like they're on a mission to gain more 'kindness superpowers' so they can make an even bigger impact. DUKERs are on a journey of continuous improvement, starting with themselves. They focus on personal growth, developing their skills, and becoming the best version of themselves. They know that by improving themselves, they'll be better equipped to help others. Maybe they're learning a new language to connect with more people, picking up a useful skill like first aid, or just working on being more patient and understanding. They might volunteer at a local charity, support businesses that give back, or simply be super nice to everyone they meet. Whatever it is, DUKERs are always looking for new ways to spread some good vibes and make their contributions even more meaningful. And here's a cool thought - maybe someday, when kids are asked, Who's the coolest person, or what's the coolest job in the world?" they might say, "Oh, definitely that DUKER named Max, or anything DUKER-related! How awesome would that be?

Dukiness (pronounced /ˈdjuːkiːnəs/). Alright, let's dive into Dukiness. It's a powerful idea about reshaping how we approach making the world better. At its core, Dukiness is about decentralization. We're not waiting for some president or politicians to solve everything. Sure, there are good folks in those roles, but Dukiness says it's about all of us stepping up. We're talking about supporting the just ones, building systems that truly serve people, and using tech like blockchain to keep things fair. Picture a world where power is spread out, not just concentrated at the top. When Dukiness talks about kindness, it means action. It's like that saying, "Show me your faith without deeds, and I'll show you my faith by my deeds." In Dukiness, being kind means you've got a responsibility – to grow, to live up to your full potential. It's about doing the work, not just talking about it. And here's the key – Dukiness is universal. It's not limited to certain people or places. It's a global concept, a human idea, originating from the 'all lives matter worldwide'. We're talking kindness and fairness for everyone, everywhere. So, Dukiness isn't just a nice thought – it's a call to action. It's about creating a world where everyone has the power to make things better, where kindness is shown through actions, and where these principles apply to all.
