As a non-American, I cannot vote in U.S. elections. However, as a global citizen, I sincerely hope American voters will choose a leader who embodies these ideals: one who can confront harsh realities with determination, apply common sense to complex problems, resolve and prevent conflicts rather than introduce or exacerbate them, unite different groups of people rather than divide them, prioritize the wellbeing of their own tax-paying citizens first for fairness, and also care for the wellbeing of all people worldwide for kindness(e.g. championing DUKI, etc.) . This hope extends to all nations. May all countries find such leaders. God bless America and all nations worldwide.
