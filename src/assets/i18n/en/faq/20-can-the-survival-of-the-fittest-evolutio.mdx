Saturday holds a special place in many traditions, including Christianity, which emphasizes the importance of companionship on this day. As I accompanied my son to his roller skating class today, watching him learn with enthusiasm, I found myself reflecting on deeper meanings of this companionship practice. This wisdom transcends space, time, and religions: regardless of our ambitions or responsibilities, we should always prioritize some time with family. It's a universal best practice that doesn't require religious affiliation. Being to Actions, after all, speak much louder than symbolizing with words. In today's world, it's easy to say we adhere to beliefs, but how do we truly be the beliefs and prove that there is something like love inside the beliefs? After all, love can never be touched or seen and verified using ordinary science. We can only prove our free will's love and its existence using zero-knowledge proof consistently - by accompanying the lives of our loved ones and cherishing them.

After the lesson, there's a game for all the kids learning roller skating. It's a survival of the fittest game - the classic and popular musical chairs game. Here's how it works: Small chairs are set up, but there aren't enough for everyone. The children circle around the chairs while the teacher plays music. When the music stops, they must quickly find a chair to sit on. Each child can only occupy one chair, and no chair can seat two kids. There are always fewer chairs than children, so some will not survive and inevitably be left out

As I watched, I saw parallels to life's broader 'survival of the fittest' dynamic. Ideally, the kids should compete enthusiastically like in the game even as they grow up, focusing intensely on the present moment to secure their place. Those who don't 'survive' each round could also remain joyful, understanding they are all in love. They are the beliefs that they are all loved and the game is just a pure form of competition - striving to excel, but without dire consequences for those who don't make it. But in reality, many of us as parents hold different beliefs that competition is all about defeating others for ourselves to survive, or survive better, where failure is inevitably associated with bad things. Since the world do not love the ego, the ego should also not love the world. We embody these beliefs inevitably in the current world - we are shaped by our parents and by the beliefs of people worldwide, which have shaped the harsh reality of the world. Think about the people who can't pay for housing because of job loss, think of those who are starving and struggling at the basic survival level, think about the innocents who have died and are dying in mass conflicts like wars - if they do not hold these beliefs, they can hardly survive.

This prompted me to reflect on the possibility of 'DUKI in Action' again: could our world adopt a similar approach? One where we compete and evolve, but failure doesn't spell catastrophe? Where even those who don't 'survive' a round face no severe consequences and are still free to reject evil and do good?

In contrast, our current world often falls short of this ideal. If you lose your job or your business fails, you may struggle to afford food, shelter, and other necessities - then free will is not truly free anymore and can easily fall into that sin.

The same applies to any organization too. I saw an example where a church asked a popular star to perform a concert inside the Church, maybe it is struggling with the original sin of survival too. I was on social media, where I believe a certain percentage of accounts exist without genuine human intent, their existence merely to satisfy financial motives, mostly marketing, also some kind of evil like fake bot accounts or those used to promote unsavory activities.

Thinking about people and organizations around me, it seems that all lives and all organizations are born with that original sin - they must be able to survive first, then may gain the wisdom and power to reject evil, do good and spread love. This may indeed be the case, as many religious texts and philosophies speak of being born with sin or needing to overcome suffering, acknowledging that life is hard. Perhaps the key is to engage with life's challenges through love, ensuring our survival without compromising our morality. The ideal would be a world where, even if one doesn't 'survive as fittest” in the game of life - losing a job or facing business failure - they still live in freedom and can freely spread love instead of hatred.

On our way home, my son surprised me with an unexpected topic: <a className='speaker1'>Dad, my classmate are going to travel to foreign countries,</a> he said excitedly. After a few exchanges, I asked, <a className='speaker0'>Oh? Which country would you like to visit when you grow up?</a> <a className='speaker1'>America!</a> he replied without hesitation. Curious, I probed further. <a className='speaker0'>Why America?</a> <a className='speaker1'>Because they have hamburgers,</a> he answered matter-of-factly. He enjoys watching the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants. Amused by his reasoning, I continued, <a className='speaker0'>Would you want to become an American if you could?</a>,<a className='speaker1'>I want to, because there are easy hamburgers every day,</a> he said with conviction. Pretending to be angry, I exclaimed, <a className='speaker0'>What? What's wrong with our own nation? Your daddy was born here and love the people here and is a potrait! Why would you want to be American?</a>, <a className='speaker1'>Because I can eat hamburgers,</a> he replied simply.<a className='speaker0'>You want to become American just because of hamburgers?</a> I asked, incredulous., <a className='speaker1'>Yes, they eat them every day like it's easy,</a> he insisted. Shaking my head in amusement, I suggested, <a className='speaker0'>Okay, today let's buy some hamburgers out there. Will you still want to be American?</a> His response was immediate:<a className='speaker1'>Oh no, I don't want to anymore.</a> <a className='speaker0'>Alright, let's go buy some hamburgers then,</a> I offered, but to my surprise, he refused. <a className='speaker0'>Grandma wouldn't be happy,</a> he added thoughtfully. <a className='speaker0'>She thinks they're much too 'hot' and not healthy.</a>

This innocent exchange led me to reflect on immigration and global inequality again. It reinforced the soundness of DUKI in action. Perhaps we could offer 'hamburgers' to everyone, actually solving the immigration problem and dissolving all lives' original sin. This could be driven by humanity's natural kindness, guided by religious teachings, chosen through free will, or simply exist as a fundamental right. If we truly believe all lives matter, shouldn't we - as part of the all - do what matters to create a world where DUKI is in action to remind all lives of the existence of universal kindness and their duty to empower all lives to have the freedom to reject evil, do good and make more love for the world? Perhaps we could Make All Great Again (MAGA?).

Always remember, DUKI is an option, not an obligation. It's a free will choice for those with love, and a way to prove the existence of love inside your beliefs. As the Bible says, 'Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.'

Personally, I found DUKI in action feels so scientifically sound when used as a niche marketing strategy. It plays so nicely with evolution of the fittest and the willed 'all lives matter worldwide' beliefs. It seems a gift from The Unknownable, if implemented together with a fully zero-knowledge proof human passport on blockchain.

Also, let me remind you of other coincidences here. What is the first impression that comes to your mind when you first encounter the symbol 'DUKI'? Is it 'dookie'? It may be the same for many minds who think of SHIT when they see ALM and AllLivesMatterWorld because of the historical controversy there. But they are not. These symbols should not be abandoned just because evil was once associated with them. All symbols can be used and associated with evil; can we abandon all symbols? Actually, the symbols were originally invented as a kind reminder, maybe from The Unknownable. They are duty, kindness, and cookie combined. We should never let them become #TheLostSymbol. The things that should be abandoned like DOOKIE are the evil interpretations of the symbols, not the symbols themselves which could be used to host good.

May All Never Blindly Judge Indifferent Symbols As Good Or Evil and Got Lost In Darkness!

May All Embrace The Belief That AllLivesMatterWorld is the Will of The Unknownable - However We Name Him!

May All Be The Beliefs that All Lives Matter Worldwide!

May All Transcend Symbols In the Light Of Symbols, Be the Wisdom And Find Him!

May All Be Love!
