Black Lives Matter is a great movement that has made a great positive impact on the world. It inspires great aspirations and illuminates a path forward in the face of prejudice and injustice. As long as unfairness exists, the world can draw inspiration and guidance from BLM. Thanks, BLM. Thanks to all the people who make it great.

Taking inspiration from BLM(too) and considering the unnecessary death, hurt, and hatred caused by mass conflicts, whether it's the wars orchestrated by those who wield power without conscience, the senseless violence and unjustified hatred inflicted on innocent individuals or the entire groups due to the actions of a few bad actors within them, or the widespread suffering caused by systemic oppression and discrimination, the new advocacy emerges. All Lives Matter Worldwide: Global Calling for Peace , Advocating Kindness, Fairness, and DUKI for all. And I believe that by fully embracing this approach, we can strive to significantly reduce mass conflicts and foster a society where everyone has the opportunity to cultivate their own merits. In this vision, individuals are valued fairly based on the merits of their behaviors, not by their color, nationality, gender, religion, and the powers that claim to speak for their soul, nor by any other characteristic that has been or could be used as a basis for unfair discrimination.
