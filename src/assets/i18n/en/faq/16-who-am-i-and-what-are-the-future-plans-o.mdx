I don't know what the future holds for this advocacy. I sensed my dukiness and initiated it, and I will give it an initial boost and keep advocating for it until the end of my life or until I'm forcibly stopped by circumstances beyond my control. As I believe, 'All Lives Matter World' is unstoppable. The source code is released under 'DUKI LICENSE', which is essentially the same as the MIT license with an additional condition: if you're using the code as a profit-making entity and your entity turns a profit, you should donate at least 1% to DUKI. Currently, there's no DUKI system in place for donations or to verify this behavior, but you can still fulfill this spirit by showing kindness to those who need help. In the future, if possible, I'll try to bootstrap one or more tiny DUKIGEs, though currently I have no idea what they would be like. Moreover, please don't expect too much from me – I'm just an ordinary person with a challenging life to maintain. I can only pursue this advocacy in my spare time or, better yet, through a job that enables me to continue this work while simultaneously earning a living.
