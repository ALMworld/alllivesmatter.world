After the poem written jointly by me, the LLM, and perhaps God, I decided to share my personal story about why I initiated the "All Lives Matter World" advocacy.

I consider myself agnostic, recognizing the limitations of my understanding, and standing fully aware and in awe of The Unknowable. As an ordinary person, I believe that the 'All Lives Matter World' is a good free will. Assuming God exists, I believe that is God's will also. GOOD FREE WILL LIVES FOREVER and GOD'S WILL LIVES FOREVER.

I will not argue whether God exists or not, but I have a strong belief that if God does exist, then 'all lives matter world' is His Will, and He will be angry if His Will is abandoned like shit.

The intriguing coincidences I've experienced may suggest something greater, hinting at intelligent design. Like a zero-knowledge proof, they demonstrate possibilities without revealing the underlying truth.

Let me share some coincidences that led me to initiate the advocacy. Are they pure coincidences, or are they a form of zero-knowledge proof that God is trying to demonstrate His existence without revealing it to me? I do not know. But if God does exist and loves using zero-knowledge to prove His existence, He will forgive me for being agnostic and will praise me for having awe for The Unknowable.

I was born a bit of a science enthusiast, especially when it comes to physics and math. I did receive some inspiration from a few great minds in high school, particularly from my physics teacher. I’m sorry to say that I haven’t been in touch with him since graduation, and I’ve never let him know how much I appreciate his guidance and inspiration. I believe that computer science could have been a good fit for me in college, but I never had the opportunity to major in it. By the time I understood my options, my decisions had already been made, making it difficult to change course.

I majored in ecology. I was not interested in much of the content or how it was taught in college most of the time, but the concepts of ecological and evolutionary processes and modern biology knowledge indeed captured my interest. I also learned about swarms, whose global intelligence emerged from simple units following simple rules like the evolutionary principle of survival of the fittest. I even took inspiration from that for my web name. Anyway, this kind of knowledge and inherent curiosity prepared my mind for evolutionary thinking.

However, my college experience wasn’t solely defined by my major. There were other experiences that helped shape my personality and intellectual growth.

In my first year of college, I discovered a fascination with philosophy. Though I didn’t know much about it, I borrowed a book from the library written by Arthur Schopenhauer, "Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung" (in English, "The World as Will and Representation"). I was captivated and tried to think as the author did. I remember discussing the concept of Will-thing with my maybe ex-girlfriend, sitting by a warm fireplace on a snowy night. What a wonderful experience, though maybe I never kissed her, and now we are both fathers and mothers and have never contacted once.

Also, I got my first computer as a gift for college entry. Yes, that was a wonderful thing for me, a person who, until then, rarely watched TV because my family never got one, just like many others I knew. It was a fascinating thing, but sadly I never used it to learn something interesting systematically, mainly for gaming and surfing the news. I was often saddened by news headlines about coal miner accidents where many people died.

I was far away from home, and my father was an ordinary miner worker. He worked as a coal miner. Before I went to college, I went with him to the deep, dark underground and worked along with him once. It was not a modern workspace like we saw on television; it was quite raw. There were many tunnels that were dug by hand with simple tools, tunnels that barely allowed one person to crawl in. The miners would crawl into these narrow passages with their tools, dig coal, and then drag it out to reach the railway. There was no light, only a tiny lamp on their heads. All you could see was darkness, and all you could touch was coal. Under these conditions, accidents that caused deaths sometimes occurred.

I was worried about my father whenever I saw this kind of news, but luckily, though some accidents happened, my father was okay and eventually retired. Thank God. At that time, whenever I saw this kind of news, I hoped the world would do something to care for the miners' safety. I emotionally commented on the news to urge people to take action, and after many tries, I realized that free will seemed powerless, the world moved as usual, and these tragedies still happened quite often nowadays. I was an angry youth, furious at everyone's indifference.

But during my third year, I took a literature elective course and became fascinated by a regionalist writer. The author just described people as they were, with humanity and understanding. Maybe affected by this free will, and after some reflection, I realized that my mother and father were just like the indifferent people I was angry at. They didn’t care about these complex issues; sometimes they enjoyed hatred war movies, gaining a sense of pride when our nation won in the movies. They didn’t care about politics that much, and maybe deep in their minds and experiences they believed not all lives matter that much, and they saw themselves among those who didn’t matter. They just wanted to live their lives and take care of their children, hoping that their children would get a proper education and live a not-so-hard life, and that's it. They had kind hearts and were good to their neighbors, unless some practical conflicts arose, just like the neighbors did. Many times they cared about partiality over totality, maybe because they didn't have the wisdom to discern right from wrong, or maybe that's the nature of free will, always wanting to join together with the free will of similar people—I think this could perhaps be better explained by the selfish gene theory.

After this realization, I was no longer that angry anymore. I understood there was always a reason behind the tragic events that happened, perhaps viewing them as conflicts of free will using Arthur Schopenhauer’s thinking. Maybe some of those people never had proper education, or they may never have felt much kindness from the world except from a few family members; some didn’t even get love from their family and most probably, they might have experienced significant hostility and hardship from the world. They could have great talents, potential, and acquired wisdom, but unfortunately, the world rarely gave them the opportunity to cultivate these. They just needed to blindly do anything that could ensure their survival. There was always a reason. It is not purely their fault to blame; the constant struggle against hostility and adversity could have shaped their perspectives and actions. And probably, I wouldn’t do better than them if I had lived the lives they lived, facing the hostilities they faced. The free will of goodness may never get the freedom to fully grow.

Anyway, I just felt a hint of the world’s coldness, but I still did not fully experience the merciless reality out there. My parents shielded me from much of it, and I remained a relatively carefree youth. I lived happily for four years with my roommates, building deep friendships. That was really one of the happiest moments in my life.

Time to graduate, I still did not know what to do. I didn’t have enough knowledge to decide. I was curious about how the mind works. Deep in the night, some words emerged from my mind, one word after another. (Yes, before that time, LLM was not a thing like it is currently now) I wondered if human minds are determined or not. Is there a probability that, given certain circumstances including previous situations of mind and body, we can predict what our next word and deed will be? As an afterthought, this kind of thinking is similar to how LLMs work, as I currently learned. It also relates to my mother’s epilepsy. I wondered, a few times, why she goes into a near-unconscious state, moving instinctively and saying caring and loving words to her boy. (Sorry, Mom; your love for me is so selfless and God-like. You are truly one of the people I cherish most, and maybe your love is the real reason I want the world to be kinder and nicer to people like you.) Only later did I find out that this behavior is triggered by electrotherapy, which is unsuitable for people with epilepsy, yet was recommended without conscience by profit-driven salesmen who hinted it was beneficial for everyone in any situation.

Anyway, driven by curiosity about how the brain works, I tried to choose a graduate advisor who studied neuroscience. However, after spending some time learning and working with a doctor in the same lab, I found that their research was too simple to satisfy my inquisitive mind. Additionally, a senior doctoral colleague, who was planning to leave the research field to become a medical doctor, advised me to think seriously about my career path. Ultimately, I decided not to pursue that route. Instead, I chose an easier path and continued my studies in ecology but quit after about a year to work outside academia.

Although I didn’t continue my studies in ecology, the knowledge I gained made me accustomed to thinking in ecological and evolutionary way. Darwin’s concept of survival of the fittest revealed hard truths about the universe. The idea of the selfish gene illuminated the reality that we should never assume others are angels and explained how selfish love and hate can make sense. It also showed why we should strive for peace, as destroying each other would be counterproductive causing all genes to be lost. The evolution of cooperation and the conflicts arising from selfishness, such as those in sexual selection, could actually give rise to angelic behavior in humans — those who prioritize kindness and always strive for fairness.

Anyway, after quitting, I struggled to find a junior job in the tech sector. I learned the Spring framework and about transactions that are atomic — once done, they never roll back, so we must be careful and ensure all necessary effects are in place for the commit. I worked hard from early 9 to late 9 and sometimes six days a week just to support my family and maintain my independence. I felt the reality of the world that was always there; it was a tough and inspiring experience. Life is not easy, especially for ordinary people. The world outside their family and friends does not offer much kindness to most. The world cares more about competition and profit; some compete for excellence, but most do so just for survival and profit. Companies and bosses are also subject to the harsh, objective rules of survival of the fittest. Those that don’t rely on government relationships must maintain high efficiency to maximize their chances of survival in the merciless Darwinian business world. They need to make profits to survive, which can lead them to push harder on ordinary employees to achieve this.

Almost everyone and every organization competes to be the fittest. It’s quite an eye-opening experience. All entities face challenges; they each have different battles to confront, whether you’re an ordinary worker, a company, or a millionaire looking to multiply your profits. They all adhere to the rule of survival of the fittest. This kind of competitiveness can sometimes make us forget what we’re truly competing for, leading to a lack of kindness and even to evil behavior. My mother worked day and night during her younger days; she has grown old but is not entitled to a pension that she should get to support her survival. Universal kindness is not that common in our modern society.

For me, the situation was better than in her days, although I was occupied with work, I still had some spare time. I sometimes wished I could find more meaning in it instead of just making money and competing for survival. During my spare time, I maintained the habit of absorbing wisdom from MOOCs and MOOC-like resources. I treated it as an opportunity for free will exploration; some resources had practical utility, while others were simply for curiosity.

During my exploration, I learned about bitcoins and bought some at a very early stage. However, I missed out on a significant fortune because I sold before it skyrocketed. I’m excited about WorldID and Worldcoin, even though I lost some money when Worldcoin dropped from 5 to 1 and my account got banned by their official team on X due to my advocacy for "all lives matter world". I took a few MOOCs and watched some videos to try to understand how the magic works. Through this experience, I learned about what decentralization is and how it is unstoppable — though I don’t know much about the technical details yet. I sensed that it could be a way for the world where all lives truly matter, even for those in the shadows like me. Yes, 'all lives matter worldwide' is the truth the world should uphold. It is not just duty, kindness, and care for all lives worldwide; it’s also a superpower for everyone. Holding it, everyone has the power to demand that they be treated with fairness.

About a year ago, in 2023, the company decided to cut jobs, and I was one of them. I received a pension and took a break. I thought to myself, should I continue without a break, or maybe take some time off (how about one gap year) to do something that satisfies my free will? Better yet, could I find a way to do both — satisfy my free will and make a living at the same time? So, I went on tour, did some other things, and built an English learning app. I finished it and published it, but at the time of writing, I’m pretty sure no more than 100 people have downloaded my app. I knew nothing about marketing and was really bad at it.

During that marketing time, I came across Trump’s interview where he said, "I want everyone to stop dying; they are dying." This call resonated deeply with me. I remembered the worry I felt about my father and the despair I experienced during my college years when I saw news about miners dying. I witnessed this brave and compassionate heart being attacked and humiliated, labeled as a coward and puppet by those with evil intentions or indifference. Rather than stand by uselessly, I decided to take action as an ordinary human who believes that all lives should matter and also that all lives do matter. That’s how this advocacy was born. I just wish for peace for everyone.

During the advocacy’s initial phase, I composed the 9 letters except the one for God. Last night, my X account was blocked. I can’t log in and was locked out. I’m reading about it on reddit; it says 24 hours and some say 3 days. I wish it will be okay. I can feel Elon Musk's free will and his respect for others’ free will, but he doesn’t have the power or right to make everyone obey his will.

During that sleepless night, the poem about free will came to my mind, and I prompted it and it was born. Really, I truly enjoy it—a zero-knowledge proof that God may be proving His existence to me. I am worried more about the free will seed getting killed. The worries extend to Cloudflare too. What if the company decides to take it down? I suddenly thought of Web3 domain names. It's better to put it on the blockchain and make it more censorship-resistant, so I bought alllivesmatterworld.eth (the alllivesmatter.eth was already taken) and kindkang.eth, also alllivematterworld.unstoppable and a few other domains.

I will finish the letters to God as soon as possible and try to put the website on alllivesmatterworld.unstoppable, and then actively seek a Web3 job, hoping to get hired by a great company to make a living. My wife sometimes pretends to be angry at my apparent unwillingness to actively seek jobs due to my focus on the advocacy. Initially, I argued, "How could you not respect this good free will? Look at what I’m doing." Later, I found it amusing. What does "fairness always" really mean? Certainly, she has a right to demand fairness and be angry — after all, don’t all lives matter? She has already shown me so much kindness and love. I should respond to her kindness with kindness, not exploit or take advantage of it. I must fulfill my duties as a husband. (please don’t misunderstand, my family is not poor, just financially ordinary). Also, the promise of a one-year gap for my free will satisfaction is almost complete. "Fairness Always" — I’ve found real peace in this realization, and I hope I always remember it.

After this realization and the emergence of NFT ideas during the Web3 domain registration process, I've decided to reflect on some of the promises I made previously. Originally, I said that I wouldn't accept donations or attempt to commercialize this advocacy for personal gain, now or in the future. However, considering that all lives matter and all lives must follow the harsh rules of reality—which may have been established by God—pretending to be a selfless angel and expecting others to do the same is both impractical and counterproductive. That's not the right path. This promise is too restrictive; it fails to recognize the value of entrepreneurship and discourages innovation.

Therefore, I am no longer bound by that constraint. I am free to pursue any partnership, deal, or opportunity that could help transform DUKI from a mere vision into a living reality—one that could truly help instead of just talking.

As this journey of reflection comes to a close, I am compelled to acknowledge and express my gratitude. I want to say to the people who have shown kindness to me, whether I've met them or not—be it family, inspiring teachers, friends, or simply inspiring minds and MOOC educators—thank you. Your words, deeds, and kindness really matter to me. And to all other people out there: your lives truly matter and are especially invaluable to those to whom you've shown your kindness and love.

To all lives in the world: Just by exercising your duty with a loving heart, you are being divine to the world, whether you are ordinary or extraordinary.

And if there is a God, all lives are gods; all lives are children of the Most High. All lives have the power and duty of God.

Whether you believe in God or not, let us use this power and exercise this duty, and fight together for a world where all lives truly matter—this is His will and our free will's destiny.
