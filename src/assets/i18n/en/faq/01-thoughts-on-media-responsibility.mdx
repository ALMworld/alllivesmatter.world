(My comment on some media narraibtive about the above video) Instead of highlighting Trump's focus on stopping the war and saving lives for humanity, reports headlined 'Trump won't say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to win war'. Rather than acknowledging Trump's urging of Europe to increase support for fairness and to strengthen Ukraine, narratives suggested he refused to back Ukraine in its war with Russia. The media fixated on calling Putin a 'war criminal' and on winning, and <a className='inline_ref' target='new' href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240818232941/https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/11/christie-trump-cnn-putin-00096393">some</a> resorted to labeling Trump a 'coward' and a 'puppet of Putin' for his approach of trying to end the conflict without losing more lives. These narratives treat war like a video game, focusing on winning and losing, implying that some innocent lives are more valuable than others, while ignoring that humanity as a whole loses in the wars.

Our minds are like gardens(cf. LLM), cultivated by the words we consume. If we are fed a diet of hatred, we grow thorns of prejudice. But when nourished with kindness, we blossom into compassion. And our society's culture is a vast forest made up of these individual mind-gardens. Media serves as one of the primary sources of nutrients for this forest. When it spreads bias, it’s like dumping toxic waste into the soil. But when it promotes fact-based reporting, humanity, and understanding, it enriches the entire ecosystem.

Media should always wield its influence wisely. Present facts first, then offer various perspectives. Let people see the full picture and always respect their intelligence and right to form their own views. Similarly, media amplifiers should never manually manipulate news 'fitness' to favor certain powers, such as strong governments, nor should they be influenced by bribes. If anything should be favored, it should always be facts, demonstrating a commitment to the whole truth. Media amplifiers like social platforms, search engines, and other recommendation-based platforms could achieve this by prioritizing evolvable news stories rather than static ones. Evolvable news means that once published, it remains open to iterative updates and refinements. It allows for public criticism and community notes, both positive and negative. This iterative process enables people to witness the evolution of the story over time and form their own views, even when those views may challenge some authority. True authorities welcome freedom of speech. When faced with criticism, instead of resorting to censorship or inaction, they conduct further validation to prove their authenticity. With great power comes great responsibility. Media and media amplifiers should always strive to cultivate a forest of well-informed minds.
