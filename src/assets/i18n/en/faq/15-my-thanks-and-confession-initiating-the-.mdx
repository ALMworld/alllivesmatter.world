I'm deeply grateful to the many people and innovations that have shaped this advocacy. While it's impossible to name everyone and everything, I'd like to acknowledge some key influences: Donald Trump's call for "I want everyone to stop dying," Tommee Profitt's rendition of "O come, O come, Omeemsu," and the BLM movement's slogan "Black Lives Matter" (too) have been key inspirations. The evolutionary discoveries by Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins, and Robert Axelrod laid the groundwork underpinning this advocacy. "Freedom as the right to say no" and "Freedom as the power to say no" inspired 'DUKI In Action'. These freedom concepts have roots in both historical minds like George Orwell and contemporary thinkers, such as Karl Widerquist. While the former is a truth to uphold, the latter addresses a practical challenge: what if exercising this right becomes unaffordable under unjust rule? As the saying goes, 'When the wicked rule, the people groan.' Thus, DUKI helps to empower all lives to say no to the unrighteous. Avi Wigderson's "Everything that can be proven at all can be proven in zero knowledge" highlights the DUKI system's technological plausibility, with blockchain innovations like zkVM and Worldcoin's WorldID further backing it up. I sincerely hope all these blockchain-related innovations will be used or evolved to make the DUKI system a reality, leaving countries that serve the people no excuse to refuse it. Tools from Facebook's ReactJS, and affordable services from Cloudflare and Zoho have been crucial, and insights from the X platform have reinforced my sense of duty. AI pioneers have expanded possibilities beyond imagination, letting me engage with great minds like Lord Acton's thoughts on power and liberty and various profound ideas from the Bible, and also assisting in refining my words. Without all of this, an ordinary person like me would never have been able to initiate this advocacy. I credit all these efforts, along with mine, to the goodness of humanity. This initiative reflects our collective goodness, and I hope this spirit continues to shape and support it in both visible and unseen ways.

I need to make a confession. In my efforts to learn, grow, and initiate this advocacy, I illegally accessed certain services like search engines, social platforms, and AI models through a VPN and don't use my real name. This wasn't a decision I made lightly. It was driven by a genuine desire to make a positive impact in a situation where I felt there were no legal or ethical alternatives. I want to be clear that I never used these tools for harmful purposes. My intention was solely to expand my understanding and contribute to the task at hand. I'm not trying to make excuses or blame anyone for defining these actions as 'illegal,' given the complex and harsh realities the world faces now. My hope is that when fighting against evil, we always fight with humanity and compassion, ensuring we don't become the very thing we're opposing.

I also want to confess that I'm trying to piggyback on free tiers of services like Zoho, Canva, X, GitHub, and Cloudflare, which don't require immediate payment for essential usage. Even though these companies excel at their services and have shown initial kindness through their free tiers, I still won't upgrade to premium unless I see the need to, given the limited resources of an ordinary person. While kindness doesn't always guarantee reciprocation, and too many individuals taking advantage could potentially corrupt such generosity, violating the principle that 'kindness begets kindness', I sincerely hope those with means and a concern for freedom will prefer these generous companies when choosing between comparable options. If they meet both needs and budget, why not support them? They may primarily focus on marketing, but they actually support freedom in practice. Looking ahead, I sincerely hope the DUKI system becomes a reality, empowering everyone to support companies that excel at their offerings and also spread kindness, without the hesitation and second thoughts I've experienced.
