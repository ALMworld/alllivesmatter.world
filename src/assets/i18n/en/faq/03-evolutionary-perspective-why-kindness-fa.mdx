Nature can be harsh, often governed by principles like 'survival of the fittest'—a concept that, at its core, seems to have little to do with  kindness,fairness and DUKI. However, the truth illustrated in the book 'The Evolution of Cooperation' suggests that within a species, the 'fittest' can also be those who spread kindness and build reciprocity to reduce conflicts. This is why we should strive to build reciprocal relationships and promote fairness: to avoid mass conflicts that result in collective loss.

Moreover, deep in our human genome lies the potential for our species to be the 'fittest' - not through competition, but through carefully fostering every talent and embracing human diversity in all its forms. To truly thrive as a species, we must value all lives and empower everyone to learn, grow, and live to their full potential. This approach doesn't just make us stronger in everyday life; it prepares us for any challenge, even existential threats. Imagine if we faced a powerful adversary in the future - we would need every unique skill and perspective our species has to offer. By nurturing our collective potential, we ensure our fitness and adaptability as a whole species.

The rules of fitness that lie in natural laws—kindness, fairness, and love (c.f. DUKI) for all—may be a universal principle that transcends our understanding.
