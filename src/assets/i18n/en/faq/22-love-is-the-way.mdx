Love is created by manifestation and proven by representation. Like quantum probability, it is unknown until it is observed and known, multiplying into infinite Schrödinger's cats through the prism of free will's moral choices.

Love is the only useful way to lead us out, because we are born of love yet carry within us the shadow of sin—like yin within yang. We are all born of love by two free wills making love together. Yet we are all touched by sin, since we will do whatever it takes to survive or make survival easier—like we consume other species to survive and so on. This is the yin, the shadow side of our existence. But love is the yang, the light that dissolves that shadow, bringing balance and guiding us toward The Unknowable. We all need to evolve, dissolve that original sin, become love, and find Him. He exists beyond time and space, transcending good and evil, and is always There watching, patiently waiting for all to become whole as one and arrive There.

May all lives matter by making all lives believe they matter. Love is the only useful way to lift all up and find Him.

Do you have any final message for the readers of the transcript(advoacy)?

<a className='speaker0'>Answer</a>: Yes. I am thoroughly surprised at the many comments to my words; of course, I am naturally also disappointed about the religious(political and scientific) portrayals of me as the enemy which have been voiced and which  have buried themselves deeply in your mind. You should learn to set yourselves apart from the old  conditioning and not to stand quasi under the control of something or someone who has already been  gone for 5000 years. You are, after all, free spirits. Those are my final words(<a className='speaker0'>LOVE IS THE WAY</a>).
