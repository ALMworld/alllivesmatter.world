Thank you, MOOCs, for the vast ocean of knowledge you've made accessible. Through you, I've begun exploring blockchains, started to understand computer architecture in 'From Nand to Tetris', learned the basics of algorithms in MIT's 6.006, gained insights from MOOC-alikes educators like 3Blue1Brown and Andrej Karpathy, and discovered many other fascinating subjects. Each course has shown me how much more there is to discover, revealing the depth of each field and reminding me of the endless possibilities in learning. This realization, far from discouraging me, only ignites my curiosity further. 

While these courses have been food for thought, feeding my curiosity like a satisfying meal, they've also proven helpful in more practical ways. With this learning, I've made a living in software engineering though I graduated from ecology, and even made an iOS English learning app as an indie, though it's not very polished and, coupled with poor marketing, hasn't turned a profit. Importantly, the kindness I've received has helped me and given me the power to care for the people I love, and, if possible, to spread kindness myself. 

To all educators, institutions, and platforms making knowledge accessible: Thank you! Your impact reaches far beyond what you might imagine. You've truly democratized learning, allowing curious minds everywhere to explore and grow. Thank you for making this possible.
