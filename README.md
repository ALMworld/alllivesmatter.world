******A Global Call for Humanity and Compassion******

* **Kindness**  A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees.
* **Fairness** You shall judge the people with righteous judgment. You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality, and you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of the righteous
* **DUKI: By People, For People** He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

DUKI (pronounced 'duÀêki', reminiscent of 'duty','kindness' and 'cookie') stands for Decentralized Universal Kindness Income. It refers to money distributed to everyone as an act of kindness, generated through the hard works of kind people around the world. DUKI aim to empower people to reject evil, do good, and spread kindness.
