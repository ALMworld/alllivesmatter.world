******A Global Call for Humanity and Compassion******

* **Kindness First**  A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees.
* **Fairness Always** You shall judge the people with righteous judgment. You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality, and you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of the righteous
* **DUKI In Action** He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

DUKI (pronounced 'duːki', reminiscent of 'duty','kindness' and 'cookie') stands for Decentralized Universal Kindness Income. It refers to money distributed to everyone as an act of kindness, generated through the hard works of kind people around the world. DUKI aim to empower people to gain freedom, reject evil, do good, and spread kindness.

### Why do you coin the term DUKI instead of using UBI 
- UBI (Universal Basic Income) and DUKI ('/duːki/' Decentralized Universal Kindness Income) have many similarities. However, I coined the term DUKI mainly to explicitly highlight three key aspects: decentralization, kindness, and the source of funds. While UBI could also be decentralized and kindness-based, I wanted to make these following points explicit and clear:
- Decentralization: By people, for people. Power to People, it can be implemented by anyone, any organization, anytime ,anywhere, without relying on a centralized body to create, contribute, or distribute power in the form of money. Crucially, participation must always be voluntary - no authority should ever force individuals to participate or force them out of participation. This ensures true freedom of choice, allowing people to engage or disengage based on their own will and circumstances. As Thomas Jefferson eloquently stated: 'To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.' This principle aligns perfectly with the stance on voluntary participation, emphasizing that forcing anyone to contribute to or participate in a system they disagree with is fundamentally wrong.
- Kindness-Based: It sparks the first flame of kindness, nurturing it into a roaring fire of compassion that spreads from one heart to another. DUKI ignites the human spirit - inspiring minds to learn, pushing boundaries in science, and fostering a relentless pursuit of knowledge and growth. It's a testament to what we can achieve when we lift each other up, creating a world where kindness begets kindness, and where our collective potential knows no bounds. By make the first kindness move and emphasizing reciprocity, DUKI aims to create a ripple effect of kindness that can transform societies from within.
- NotBasicIncome: It is fundamentally determined by people's kindness and ability to offer support, with reciprocity playing a crucial role. Its amount can vary widely, providing less than basic needs, or exceeding them, depending on the social context. This flexibility allows DUKI to adapt to changing social dynamics and foster a culture of mutual support. The reciprocal nature of DUKI means that those who receive kindness are encouraged to pay it forward when they're able, creating a self-sustaining cycle of generosity. This system of give-and-take can lead to significant social improvements, as it not only addresses immediate needs but also builds stronger, more interconnected communities.

Dukiness:/ˈduːkiːnəs/: spirit behind DUKI, just like kindness and fairness. Dukiness embodies the mindset and actions aligned with principles of universal kindness, fairness, and decentralized empowerment. It inspires individuals to pursue freedom, reject negativity, cultivate goodness, and spread kindness, ultimately striving to elevate the value and dignity of all lives globally.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve internationalization (i18n) and support for right-to-left (RTL) language locales are welcome.
#### To Add a New Language 
* Copy the i18n/en.json file and rename it to your target language (e.g., i18n/fr.json for French)
* Translate the values in the new file, keeping the keys unchanged
* change the constants/index.ts LANGUAGES array to include the new language
* Test the application with the new language to verify correct rendering and functionality

#### Right-to-Left (RTL) Language Support
Currently, there are no specific implementations for RTL support. Contributions are welcome. 

### Contributing Guide

The primary focus of this repository is public advocacy, rather than technical development. The original efforts are largely dedicated to cultivating ideas, refining thoughts, and carefully selecting words to express them. While there might be occasional errors or misused terms, the real value lies in the ideas themselves.
Apart from Right-To-Left (RTL) language support, the most significant contributions often come from thoughtful word choice. In this spirit, selecting the most fitting terms in the native language to accurately convey the intended messages is encouraged.

### License
'DUKI LICENSE', which is essentially the same as the MIT license, except there is a clause 'Share your success: 1% profit to DUKI when earned.'

### [The Ideas Behind DUKI License: FAQ#10](https://www.alllivesmatter.world/about):
What if new, emerging, or even legacy open-source projects released their potentially groundbreaking work with a DUKI-friendly license? This could be either a new 'DUKI[-n] License' or traditional licenses with a 'DUKI[-n] Required' clause, where 'n' represents the percentage of profit to be contributed (preferably with n between 1-5, defaulting to 1 as it's a natural starting point). Under this model, companies using DUKI-licensed projects and generating profit would be required to contribute a small percentage of their earnings towards fostering universal kindness. If they haven't made a profit, everything would remain the same as with current licenses. It's worth noting that the companies behind the creators and main maintainers of these open-source projects would be exempt from this requirement, though they could always choose to contribute voluntarily. Their act of releasing and maintaining the project as open-source is already a significant contribution, often involving substantial effort and resources. And we should reward kindness with kindness, making these companies more competitive for engaging in such generous acts. As the saying goes again, 'Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.'


The DUKI license requires companies using open-source projects to contribute n% (where n is typically 1-5) of their total business revenue towards fostering universal kindness. This model addresses the imbalance where large corporations, for example cloud providers, benefit significantly from open-source without proportionate contribution. It exempts project creators and maintainers and aims for broader societal impact rather than direct developer compensation. While potentially discouraging adoption due to financial implications, DUKI represents a shift towards using open-source as a catalyst for corporate social responsibility and global well-being.

While technology itself is inherently neutral, the DUKI license incorporates an ethical attitude towards its usage. It expresses a strong wish for the software to be used for good. By tying usage to universal kindness, DUKI encourages companies to consider the broader impact of their technological implementations.
